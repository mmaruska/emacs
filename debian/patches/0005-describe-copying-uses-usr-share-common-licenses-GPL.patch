Subject: [PATCH 05/10] (describe-copying) uses /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL

On Debian systems, the full text of the GPL is available from the
/usr/share/common-licenses directory.  The COPYING file included in
the Emacs distribution is not installed in `data-directory', so
`describe-copying' has been modified accordingly.
