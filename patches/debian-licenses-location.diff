** (describe-copying) uses /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL
   On Debian systems, the full text of the GPL is available from the
   /usr/share/common-licenses directory.  The COPYING file included
   in the Emacs distribution is not installed in `data-directory',
   so `describe-copying' has been modified accordingly.
