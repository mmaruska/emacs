** Comment text is font-locked on 8-color ttys.
   This patch undoes an upstream change and makes emacs-snapshot
   behave as emacs21 did on 8-color ttys: comment text is
   font-locked by default.

   Upstream decided to make comment text appear as regular text and
   only fontify comment delimiters, which would probably trigger
   numerous bug reports about comments not being font-locked on
   ttys.
