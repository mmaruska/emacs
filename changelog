  * The "Everything in its right place" release.

  * Not a new upstream snapshot: the trunk appears to be a dangerous place
    at the moment, let's give it some time to settle down.
  * debian/patches/tmp-fixes.dpatch: Revert a change that makes C-a skip
    over fields (closes: #349819), add a patch to fix the "cursors appear
    in all windows when the echo area is active" syndrome, other minor
    changes.

  * Introducing subflavors:
    + It is now possible to install the -x, -gtk and -nox binary packages
      concurrently, each installed package constitutes a "subflavor" of the
      emacs-snapshot flavor.  To make this possible, a number of files have
      been moved from the binary packages to -common or -bin-common, and
      /usr/bin/emacs-snapshot is now an alternative.
    + In addition, the way the packages install menu entries has been
      reworked: the text version entry is now installed in emacs-common, and
      menu/desktop entries installed by the -x and -gtk subflavors now have
      only one entry (which mentions the right subflavor instead of a plain
      "X11").
  * debian/control.in:

  * debian/control: Regenerate.

    + Run the subflavor command, not just @BIN_NAME@.
  * debian/emacs.menu.in: Remove text entry, use @SUB_FLAVOR@.
  * debian/emacs.postinst:
    + Install the subflavor alternative.
    + If we're the first subflavor of this flavor, call `emacs-install'.
    + Register the subflavor in /var/lib/@BIN_NAME@/installed-subflavors.
  * debian/emacs.prerm:
    + Remove the subflavor alternative.
    + Unregister the subflavor.
    + If we were the last installed subflavor, call `emacs-remove'.
  * debian/rules:
    + Generate emacs-common.menu, expand *.menu.in (not only emacs.menu.in).
    + Handle new replacement variable SUB_FLAVOR.
    + Set emacs subflavor to "X11", emacs-gtk subflavor to "GTK".
    + Install /var/lib/@BIN_NAME@/installed-subflavors in emacs-common.
    + Move emacs.1emacs-snapshot.gz symlink to emacs-bin-common.
    + Don't install the DOC file in binary packages, install it in
      emacs-common.
    + Don't ship a flavor symlink in binary packages (now an alternative).
    + Don't remove the DOC file from the emacs-common tree.
    + Call dh_installmenu in binary-indep target, too.
  * debian/emacs-common.overrides.lintian: Add override to silence lintian
    about the missing /usr/bin/emacs-snapshot.

emacs-snapshot (1:20050901-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New snapshot.

  * debian/patches/debian-rpath.dpatch: New file, disables RPATH in
    emacs-x and emacs-gtk binaries.
  * debian/patches/00list: Update.

  * debian/emacs-bin-common.overrides: Add overrides for man pages
    installed as alternatives: their section is correct, and the binaries
    do have man pages.

  * debian/emacs-common.overrides: Add override for the "wrong name for
    upstream changelog" check: it's a directory, and it holds the (many)
    upstream changelogs (and the top-level changelog is now symlinked,
    too).

  * debian/rules:
    + Strip the dpatch-list-patch header line.
    + Symlink upstream top-level changelog.
    + Swap fixed and variable parts in changelog file names.

emacs-snapshot (1:20050825-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New snapshot.

  * debian/emacs-bin-common.prerm: Fix buggy loop left over from
    pre-unstable packaging, because of this no alternatives were actually
    removed when emacs-bin-common was removed... (closes: #324870).

  * debian/emacs-bin-common.postinst:
    + In emacs-snapshot, the binary named 'emacs' is moved out of the way
      before expanding @ALTERNATIVES@ so it doesn't appear in the list.
      Don't special-case for it in emacs-bin-common.postinst as it'll never
      be there.
    + Remove unused INFOFILES variable.

  * debian/rules:
    + Add upstream changelogs in /usr/share/doc so that users can have
      access to them without downloading 30M of sources.  It doesn't make
      much difference in a package that occupies more than 50M and has some
      real value for users since emacs-snapshot is a constantly moving
      target.
    + Don't install menu items for emacs-nox.

  * debian/patches/debian-licenses-location.dpatch: New patch, modifies
    `describe-copying' to find the full text of the GPL in the system-wide
    location for licenses (/usr/share/common-licenses), the COPYING file
    included in the Emacs distribution isn't installed (and differs from
    the Debian version in whitespace only).

  * New versioning scheme: the overly large version number in previous
    uploads triggered a bug in quinn-diff which resulted in emacs-snapshot
    not appearing in q-d output and thus not being rebuilt on some archs.
    The bug has been fixed in quinn-diff (thanks to Ryan Murray) but to
    prevent any further damage, I'm changing the versioning scheme to
    something sane (and mandated by Policy, see §3.2.1).
    The historical versioning scheme was of doubtful value anyway.

  * debian/changelog: Delete trailing whitespace in pre-unstable entries.

emacs-snapshot (20050819140000-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New snapshot.

  * debian/rules: README.Debian is generated from the list of Debian
    patches and its size varies depending on the number of patches, so
    dh_compress sometimes compresses it, and sometimes not.  To avoid
    having to fix the references in debian/copyright and NEWS, forcibly
    leave it uncompressed.

  * debian/patches/image-pbm-xbm.dpatch: Dropped (fixed upstream).
  * debian/patches/00list: Update.

emacs-snapshot (20050812140000-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New snapshot:
    + Fixes a bug triggered by GTK+ 2.6.9 where opened menus could
      disappear randomly in emacs-snapshot-gtk (closes: #322307).
    + Includes Tramp 2.0.50.

  * debian/patches/debian-emacs-news.dpatch: Fix reference to
    README.Debian, it isn't compressed automatically in emacs-snapshot
    (it's now installed by dh_installdocs).

  * debian/changelog:
    + Fix name of NEWS file in previous entry.
    + Add mode to the local variables section.

  * debian/rules:
    + Set pkg_name for emacs-common and emacs-bin-common to fix the
      generation of lintian override files.
    + Set flavour description.
    + Pipe dpatch-list-patch output to sed to generate outline compliant
      headings, the outline regexp used in the emacs21 packages doesn't
      match in emacs-snapshot, and it's simpler to have regular outline
      sections in the file in the first place.

  * debian/copyright.in:
    + Use the new FSF postal address (updated in COPYING in the Emacs
      sources).
    + Add 2005 to copyright years.
    + Fix location of README.Debian.
  * debian/copyright: Regenerate.

  * debian/patches/debian-font-lock-tty.dpatch: Add outline markers.
  * debian/patches/debian-vc-bfn.dpatch: Ditto.

  * debian/patches/debian-cssc-vc-backend.dpatch: Add dpatch description
    marker (caused an empty patch description in README.Debian).

  * debian/control.in: Add flavour description to the short description of
    the main package, which is emacs-snapshot in this source package
    (closes: #322180).
  * debian/control: Regenerate.

  * debian/README.in:
    + Add information section stolen from the initial NEWS entry.
    + Remove paragraph about .elc files and Leim being added to the
      upstream sources: these packages are built from a snapshot tarball for
      which neither of these things is true.
    + Remove local variables section.
    + Add note about the baz archive.

  * debian/emacs.menu.in: Add -i option to the menu command item in order
    to get the Emacs icon in the GNOME window list (and equivalent
    features in other desktop environments).
  * debian/emacs.desktop: Ditto.
