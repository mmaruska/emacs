** Override the lintian error about libungif4-dev
   We build-dep on 'libgif-dev | libungif4-dev' to allow backporting.

** Install icons properly under /usr/share/icons/hicolor
   Now that we have a complete set of icons we should use them as
   intended (and get rid of debian/emacs.xpm).

** Change the icon used in the desktop files to be the new icon
   (see also previous item)

** Use the upstream desktop file
   There are some minor differences to reconcile via a patch.

** Fix `patch_info' in debian/rules to support patches w/ diffstat
   Using quilt header --strip-diffstat but needs additional tweaks.

* P2

** Cleanup the lintian hints, some of them are wrong/outdated

** Investigate why debian-emacs-bugver.diff sometimes fails
   In http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/559 we see:

   | In GNU Emacs 23.0.60.1 (i486-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.12.10)
   |  of 2008-06-30 on elegiac, modified by Debian
   |  (emacs-snapshot package, version n tiedosto core t‰sm‰‰ hakuun)

** Upgrade to a newer debhelper compat level
   Need to investigate effect on backports (Debian and Ubuntu).

** Set up something to provide nightly builds

** Switch to lzma compression
   Will have to wait for lenny to be released, will make decompression
   faster and provide significant space savings:

   Does hardy support lzma compression?

** Build and install out of tree as emacs22 does

* P3

** Find a way to link the emacs and emacsclient alternatives
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=397631
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/emacs-snapshot/+bug/63786

** Use a machine-parseable copyright file
   See http://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat
   Will probably benefit from the license audit done for the emacs22
   dfsg split.

** Switch to a full-source Git repository for maintenance
   This requires a stable changeset source from upstream, and the
   current Git mirrors are often broken.

** Add GNUstep subflavor?
   Not sure it's worth it, and it adds constraints due to additional
   binary dependencies.
