;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides language bindings for the GnuTLS library
;; using the corresponding core functions in gnutls.c.

;; Simple test:
;;
;; (open-gnutls-stream "tls" "tls-buffer" "yourserver.com" "https")
;; (open-gnutls-stream "tls" "tls-buffer" "imap.gmail.com" "imaps")

  "Open a SSL/TLS connection for a service to a host.
Returns a subprocess-object to represent the connection.
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process' closes it.
Args are NAME BUFFER HOST SERVICE.
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer (or `buffer-name') to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
 with any buffer
Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.
Fourth arg SERVICE is name of the service desired, or an integer
specifying a port number to connect to.

This is a very simple wrapper around `gnutls-negotiate'.  See its
documentation for the specific parameters you can use to open a
GnuTLS connection, including specifying the credential type,
trust and key files, and priority string."
