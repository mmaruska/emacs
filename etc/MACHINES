This is a list of the status of GNU Emacs on various machines and systems.

Information about older releases, and platforms that are no longer
supported, has been removed.  Consult older versions of this file if
you are interested in this information.

The `configure' script uses the configuration name to decide which
machine and operating system description files `src/config.h' should
include.  The machine description files are all in `src/m', and have
names similar to, but not identical to, the machine names used in
configuration names.  The operating system files are all in `src/s',
and are named similarly.  See the `configure' script if you need to
know which configuration names use which machine and operating system
description files.

If you add support for a new configuration, add a section to this
file, and then edit the `configure' script to tell it which
configuration name(s) should select your new machine description and
system description files.

Some obsolete platforms are unsupported beginning with Emacs 23.1, see
the list at the end of this file.


** Alpha (DEC) running GNU/Linux (alpha-dec-linux-gnu)

  DEC C compiler version 5.9 (DEC C V5.9-005 on Digital UNIX V4.0f)
  is reported to produce bogus binaries of Emacs 21.2 when the
  command-line switches "-O4 -arch ev6 -tune ev6" are used.  Using
  just -O4 produces a good executable.

  For 4.0 revision 564, and 4.0A and 4.0B, Emacs 20 seems to work
  with no special configuration options.  However, if you use GCC as
  your compiler, you will need version 2.8.1 or later, as older
  versions fail to build with a message "Invalid dimension for the
  charset-ID 160".

** Apple Macintosh running Mac OS X

** Apple PowerPC Macintosh running GNU/Linux

** HP 9000 series 700 or 800 (Spectrum) (hppa1.0-hp-hpux or hppa1.1-hp-hpux)

  Emacs 20 may work on HPUX 10.  You need patch PHSS_6202 to install
  the Xaw and Xmu libraries.  On HPUX 10.20 you may need to compile with GCC;
  when Emacs was compiled with HP's C compiler, HP92453-01 A.10.32.03,
  the subprocess features failed to work.

  If you turn on the DSUSP character (delayed suspend), Emacs 19.26
  does not know how to turn it off on HPUX. You need to turn it off manually.

  If you are running HP/UX release 8.0 or later, you need the optional
  "C/ANSI C" software in order to build Emacs (older releases of HP/UX
  do not require any special software).  If the file "/etc/filesets/C"
  exists on your machine, you have this software, otherwise you do not.

** IBM RS/6000 (rs6000-ibm-aix*)

  Emacs 19.26 is believed to work; its pretest was tested.

  Compiling with the system's `cc' and CFLAGS containing `-O5' might
  fail because libXbsd isn't found.  This is a compiler bug;
  re-configure Emacs so that it isn't compiled with `-O5'.

  On AIX 4.3.x and 4.4, compiling with /bin/c89 fails because it
  treats certain warnings as errors.  Use `cc' instead.

  At last report, Emacs didn't run well on terminals.  Informed
  persons say that the tty VMIN and VTIME settings have been
  corrupted; if you have a fix, please send it to us.

  Compiling with -O using the IBM compiler has been known to make
  Emacs work incorrectly.  There are reports that IBM compiler versions
  earlier than 1.03.00.02 fail even without -O.

  As of 19.11, if you strip the Emacs executable, it ceases to work.

  If anyone can fix the above problems, or confirm that they don't happen
  with certain versions of various programs, we would appreciate it.

** IBM System/390 running GNU/Linux (s390-*-linux-gnu)

  As of Emacs 21.2, a 31-bit only version is supported on this system.

** Intel 386 (i386-*-freebsd,      i386-*-linux-gnu,
	   i386-*-cygwin,       i386-*-msdos,	i386-*-windowsnt.
	   i386 can be replaced with i486, i586, or i686)

  In the above configurations, * means that the manufacturer's name
  you specify does not matter, and you can use any name you like
  (but it should not contain any dashes or stars).

  Use i386-*-linux-gnu for GNU/Linux systems; Emacs runs as of version 19.26.
  Use i386-*-cygwin for Cygwin; Emacs builds as of version 22.1, in both X11
  and non-X11 modes.  (The Cygwin site has source and binaries for 21.2.)

  On GNU/Linux systems, Emacs 19.23 was said to work properly with libc
  version 4.5.21, but not with 4.5.19.

  On GNU/Linux, configure may fail to put these definitions in config.h:

    #define HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY
    #define HAVE_MKDIR
    #define HAVE_RMDIR
    #define HAVE_XSCREENNUMBEROFSCREEN

  To work around the problem, add those definitions by hand.
  It is possible that this problem happens only with X11R6.
  Newer system versions have fixed it.

  On NetBSD and FreeBSD, at one time, it was necessary to use
  GNU make, not the system's make.  Assuming it's installed as gmake,
  do `gmake install MAKE=gmake'.  However, more recently it is
  reported that using the system Make on NetBSD 1.3.1 works ok.

  Note that use of Linux with GCC 2.4 and the DLL 4.4 libraries
  requires the experimental "net 2" network patches (no relation to
  Berkeley Net 2).  There is a report that (some version of) Linux
  requires including `/usr/src/linux/include/linux' in buffer.c
  but no coherent explanation of why that might be so.  If it is so,
  in current versions of Linux, something else should probably be changed.

  You may find that adding -I/usr/X/include or -I/usr/netinclude or both
  to CFLAGS avoids compilation errors on certain systems.

  Some versions convince sysdep.c to try to use `struct tchars'
  but define `struct tc' instead; add `#define tchars tc'
  to config.h to solve this problem.

** Iris 4D (mips-sgi-irix6.*)

  Emacs 21.3 is reported to work on IRIX 6.5.x.

  You can build a 64-bit executable (with larger maximum buffer size)
  on Irix 6.5 by specifying the 64-bit ABI using the `-64' compiler
  flag or otherwise (see cc(1)).

  If compiling with GCC on Irix 6 yields an error "conflicting types
  for `initstate'", install GCC 2.95 or a newer version, and this
  problem should go away.  It is possible that this problem results
  from upgrading the operating system without reinstalling GCC; so you
  could also try reinstalling the same version of GCC, and telling us
  whether that fixes the problem.

** Sun 4 (sparc), Sun 386 (sparc-sun-solaris2.*,
    			       i386-sun-solaris2.*, sparc*-*-linux-gnu)

  To build a 32-bit Emacs (i.e. if you are having any sort of problem
  bootstrapping a 64-bit version), you can use the Sun Studio compiler
  and configure Emacs with:
    env CC="cc -xarch=v7" CFLAGS='' ./configure    # on SPARC systems
    env CC="cc -xarch=386" CFLAGS='' ./configure   # on x86 systems
  On Solaris 2.10, it is also possible to use /usr/sfw/bin/gcc to build
  a 32-bit version of Emacs.  Just make sure you point ./configure to
  the right compiler:

    env CC='/usr/sfw/bin/gcc -m32' ./configure

  To build a 64-bit Emacs (with larger maximum buffer size and
  including large file support) on a Solaris system which supports
  64-bit executables, use the Sun compiler, configuring something like
  this (see the cc documentation for information on 64-bit
  compilation):

    env CC="cc -xarch=v9" CFLAGS='' ./configure    # on SPARC systems
    env CC="cc -xarch=amd64" CFLAGS='' ./configure # on x86 systems

  As of version 2.95, GCC doesn't support the 64-bit ABI properly, but
  later releases may.

  Some versions of Solaris 8 have a bug in their XIM (X Input Method)
  implementation which causes Emacs to dump core when one of several
  frames is closed.  To avoid this, either install patch 108773-12
  (for Sparc) or 108874-12 (for x86), or configure Emacs with the
  `--with-xim=no' switch (you can use Leim input methods instead).

  On Solaris 2.7, building Emacs with WorkShop Compilers 5.0 98/12/15
  C 5.0 failed, apparently with non-default CFLAGS, most probably due to
  compiler bugs.  Using Sun Solaris 2.7 Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 C
  release was reported to work without problems.  It worked OK on
  another system with Solaris 8 using apparently the same 5.0 compiler
  and the default CFLAGS.

  Emacs 21.1 and 21.2 built with Sun's ProWorks PC3.0.1 compiler on
  Intel/Solaris 8 was reported to abort and dump core during startup.
  Using GCC or a newer SUN compiler (Sun WokShop 6 update 2 C 5.3
  2001/05/15) solves the problem.

  Emacs 20.5 and later work on SPARC GNU/Linux with the 32-bit ABI.
  As of release 2.95, GCC doesn't work properly with the 64-bit ABI
  (applicable on UltraSPARC), but that isn't the default mode.

  There are reports that using SunSoft cc with -xO4 -xdepend produces
  bad code for some part of Emacs.

  Some people report that Emacs crashes immediately on startup when
  used with a non-X terminal, but we think this is due to compiling
  with GCC and failing to use GCC's "fixed" system header files.

  Some Sun versions of X windows use the clipboard, not the selections,
  for transferring text between clients.  The Cut, Paste and Copy items
  in the menu bar Edit menu work with the clipboard.

  If you compile with Sun's ANSI compiler acc, you need additional options
  when linking temacs, such as
     /usr/lang/SC2.0.1/values-Xt.o -L/usr/lang/SC2.0.1/cg87 -L/usr/lang/SC2.0.1
  (those should be added just before the libraries) and you need to
  add -lansi just before -lc.  The precise file names depend on the
  compiler version, so we cannot easily arrange to supply them.

  On Solaris 2, you need to install patch 100947-02 to fix a system bug.
  Presumably this patch comes from Sun.  You must alter the definition of
  LD_SWITCH_SYSTEM if your X11 libraries are not in /usr/openwin/lib.
  You must make sure that /usr/ucblib is not in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  On Solaris, do not use /usr/ucb/cc.  Use /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc.  Make
  sure that /usr/ccs/bin and /opt/SUNWspro/bin are in your PATH before
  /usr/ucb.  (Most free software packages have the same requirement on
  Solaris.)  With this compiler, use `/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -E' as the
  preprocessor.  If this inserts extra whitespace into its output (see
  the PROBLEMS file) then add the option `-Xs'.

  If you have trouble using open-network-stream, get the distribution
  of `bind' (the BSD name-server), build libresolv.a, and link Emacs
  with -lresolv, by editing LIBRESOLV in src/Makefile.  This problem is
  due to obsolete software in the nonshared standard library.

  Note that Emacs on a Sun is not really as big as it looks.  As
  dumped, it includes around 200k of zeros between the original text
  section and the original data section (now remapped as part of the
  text). These are never swapped in.

** SuperH (sh[34]*-*-linux-gnu)

  Emacs 23.0.60 was reported to work on GNU/Linux (October 2008).
  Tested on a little-endian sh4 system (cpu type SH7751R) running
  Gentoo Linux 2008.0.

* Here are notes about some of the systems supported:

** Linux (actually GNU/Linux)

  Most of the complete systems which use the Linux kernel are close
  enough to the GNU system to be considered variant GNU systems.  We
  call them "Linux-based GNU systems," or GNU/Linux for short.

  It is not coincidence that many of the other components used with
  Linux--including GNU Emacs--were developed specifically for the GNU
  project.  The GNU project was launched in 1984 to develop a free
  complete Unix-like operating system.  To reach this goal, we had to
  develop whatever system components were not available as freely
  redistributable software from some other source.

  The GNU project wants users of GNU/Linux systems to be aware of how
  these systems relate to the GNU project, because that will help
  spread the GNU idea that software should be free--and thus encourage
  people to write more free software.  See the file LINUX-GNU in this
  directory for more explanation.

** Mac OS X

  For installation instructions see the file nextstep/INSTALL.

** MSDOS

  For installation on MSDOS, see the file msdos/INSTALL.
  See the "MS-DOS" chapter of the manual for information about using
  Emacs on MSDOS.

** MS-Windows NT/95/98/ME/2000

  For installation on all versions of the MS-Windows platform, see the
  file nt/INSTALL.

** X86_64 GNU/Linux

  No special procedures should be needed to build a 64-bit Emacs.  To
  build a 32-bit Emacs, first ensure that the necessary 32-bit system
  libraries and include files are installed.  Then use:

    env CC="gcc -m32" ./configure --build=i386-linux-gnu \
      --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib

  (using the location of the 32-bit X libraries on your system).
