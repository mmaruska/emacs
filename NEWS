emacs-snapshot (1:20071105-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Gnus version bundled with Emacs is now the development branch,
    called No Gnus.  You may wish to back up your Gnus files before
    upgrading.

emacs-snapshot (1:20070902-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Emacs now includes multi-tty support.

  * The emacs-snapshot package is now built with GTK+ support, following
    upstream where GTK+ is now the default toolkit.  The Lucid version
    isn't provided anymore.

emacs-snapshot (1:20061111-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The `emacs' alternative is now registered only once for all
    emacs-snapshot subflavors (X, GTK, nox).  Note that after upgrading
    you might have to reselect the `emacs' and `editor' alternatives
    manually, due to a bug in version 20061105-1.

  * Icons are now available in /usr/share/icons/emacs-snapshot to avoid
    problems with version-dependent directories.

emacs-snapshot (1:20060120-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It is now possible to install the -x, -gtk and -nox binary packages
    concurrently.  The new alternative `emacs-snapshot' determines which
    package owns the /usr/bin/emacs-snapshot command.

emacs-snapshot (20050805100000-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the first official release of emacs-snapshot in Debian.  These
    packages are based on the initial packaging work of Jérôme Marant and
    Rob Browning (assisted by numerous contributors) and are maintained by
    Romain Francoise <rfrancoise@debian.org>.

    Note: emacs-snapshot contains a version of the GNU Emacs editor built
    from CVS HEAD.  As such, it can contain bugs and issues that make it
    unsuitable for general use.  Experience shows that grave bugs are,
    however, quite rare and it should be stable enough for everyday use.

    This version of Emacs adds support for GTK+ widgets.  The default
    version (emacs-snapshot) still uses Lucid, a new binary package
    (emacs-snapshot-gtk) is available if you want GTK+ support.

    Several major packages have been updated or added in Emacs 22.  In
    particular, Gnus is now at version 5.11.  If you had been using the
    version of Gnus shipped in Emacs 21, starting Gnus 5.11 may convert
    files automatically and generally alter your data.  Make sure you have
    good backups.

    The complete list of patches applied to the upstream source is
    available from /usr/share/doc/emacs-snapshot-common/README.Debian.
