@section Version Control
@cindex version control

  A @dfn{version control system} is a program that can record multiple
versions of a source file, storing information such as the creation
time of each version, who made it, and a description of what was
changed.

  The Emacs version control interface is called @dfn{VC}.  VC commands
work with several different version control systems; currently, it
supports GNU Arch, Bazaar, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, RCS,
SCCS/CSSC, and Subversion.  Of these, the GNU project distributes CVS,
Arch, RCS, and Bazaar.

  VC is enabled automatically whenever you visit a file governed by a
version control system.  To disable VC entirely, set the customizable
variable @code{vc-handled-backends} to @code{nil}

@node Introduction to VC
@subsection Introduction to Version Control

  VC allows you to use a version control system from within Emacs,
integrating the version control operations smoothly with editing.  It
provides a uniform interface for common operations in many version
control operations.

  Some uncommon or intricate version control operations, such as
altering repository settings, are not supported in VC.  You should
perform such tasks outside Emacs, e.g.@: via the command line.

  This section provides a general overview of version control, and
describes the version control systems that VC supports.  You can skip
this section if you are already familiar with the version control system
you want to use.

@node Why Version Control?
@subsubsection Understanding the problems it addresses

  Version control systems provide you with three important
capabilities:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@dfn{Reversibility}: the ability to back up to a previous state if you
discover that some modification you did was a mistake or a bad idea.

@item
@dfn{Concurrency}: the ability to have many people modifying the same
collection of files knowing that conflicting modifications can be
detected and resolved.

@item
@dfn{History}: the ability to attach historical data to your data,
such as explanatory comments about the intention behind each change to
it.  Even for a programmer working solo, change histories are an
important aid to memory; for a multi-person project, they are a
vitally important form of communication among developers.
@end itemize

@node Version Control Systems
@subsubsection Supported Version Control Systems

@cindex back end (version control)
  VC currently works with many different version control systems,
which it refers to as @dfn{back ends}:

@itemize @bullet

@cindex SCCS
@item
SCCS was the first version control system ever built, and was long ago
superseded by more advanced ones.  VC compensates for certain features
missing in SCCS (e.g.@: tag names for releases) by implementing them
itself.  Other VC features, such as multiple branches, are simply
unavailable.  Since SCCS is non-free, we recommend avoiding it.

@cindex CSSC
@item
CSSC is a free replacement for SCCS.  You should use CSSC only if, for
some reason, you cannot use a more recent and better-designed version
control system.

@cindex RCS
@item
RCS is the free version control system around which VC was initially
built.  It is relatively primitive: it cannot be used over the
network, and works at the level of individual files.  Almost
everything you can do with RCS can be done through VC.

@cindex CVS
@item
CVS is the free version control system that was, until recently (circa
2008), used by the majority of free software projects.  Nowadays, it
is slowly being superseded by newer systems.  CVS allows concurrent
multi-user development either locally or over the network.  Unlike
newer systems, it lacks support for atomic commits and file
moving/renaming.  VC supports all basic editing operations under CVS.

@cindex SVN
@cindex Subversion
@item
Subversion (svn) is a free version control system designed to be
similar to CVS but without its problems (e.g., it supports atomic
commits of filesets, and versioning of directories, symbolic links,
meta-data, renames, copies, and deletes).

@cindex GNU Arch
@cindex Arch
@item
GNU Arch is one of the earliest @dfn{distributed} version control
systems (the other being Monotone).  @xref{VCS Concepts}, for a
description of distributed version control systems.  It is no longer
under active development, and has been deprecated in favor of Bazaar.

@cindex git
@item
Git is a distributed version control system originally invented by
Linus Torvalds to support development of Linux (his kernel).  VC
supports many common Git operations, but others, such as repository
syncing, must be done from the command line.

@cindex hg
@cindex Mercurial
@item
Mercurial (hg) is a distributed version control system broadly
resembling Git.  VC supports most Mercurial commands, with the
exception of repository sync operations.

@cindex bzr
@cindex Bazaar
@item
Bazaar (bzr) is a distributed version control system that supports
both repository-based and distributed versioning.  VC supports most
basic editing operations under Bazaar.
@end itemize

@node VCS Concepts
@subsubsection Concepts of Version Control

@cindex repository
@cindex registered file
   When a file is under version control, we say that it is
@dfn{registered} in the version control system.  The system has a
@dfn{repository} which stores both the file's present state and its
change history---enough to reconstruct the current version or any
earlier version.  The repository also contains other information, such
as @dfn{log entries} that describe the changes made to each file.

@cindex work file
@cindex checking out files
  The copy of a version-controlled file that you actually edit is
called the @dfn{work file}.  You can change each work file as you
would an ordinary file.  After you are done with a set of changes, you
may @dfn{commit} (or @dfn{check in}) the changes; this records the
changes in the repository, along with a descriptive log entry.

@cindex revision
@cindex revision ID
  Each commit creates a new @dfn{revision} in the repository.  The
version control system keeps track of all past revisions and the
changes that were made in each revision.  Each revision is named by a
@dfn{revision ID}, whose format depends on the version control system;
in the simplest case, it is just an integer.

  To go beyond these basic concepts, you will need to understand three
aspects in which version control systems differ.  As explained in the
next three sections, they can be lock-based or merge-based; file-based
or changeset-based; and centralized or decentralized.  VC handles all
these modes of operation, but it cannot hide the differences.

@node VCS Merging
@subsubsection Merge-based vs lock-based Version Control

  A version control system typically has some mechanism to coordinate
between users who want to change the same file.  There are two ways to
do this: merging and locking.

@cindex merging-based version
  In a version control system that uses merging, each user may modify
a work file at any time.  The system lets you @dfn{merge} your work
file, which may contain changes that have not been committed, with the
latest changes that others have committed.

@cindex locking-based version
  Older version control systems use a @dfn{locking} scheme instead.
Here, work files are normally read-only.  To edit a file, you ask the
version control system to make it writable for you by @dfn{locking}
it; only one user can lock a given file at any given time.  This
procedure is analogous to, but different from, the locking that Emacs
uses to detect simultaneous editing of ordinary files
(@pxref{Interlocking}).  When you commit your changes, that unlocks
the file, and the work file becomes read-only again.  Other users may
then lock the file to make their own changes.

  Both locking and merging systems can have problems when multiple
users try to modify the same file at the same time.  Locking systems
have @dfn{lock conflicts}; a user may try to check a file out and be
unable to because it is locked.  In merging systems, @dfn{merge
conflicts} happen when you commit a change to a file that conflicts
with a change committed by someone else after your checkout.  Both
kinds of conflict have to be resolved by human judgment and
communication.  Experience has shown that merging is superior to
locking, both in convenience to developers and in minimizing the
number and severity of conflicts that actually occur.

  SCCS always uses locking.  RCS is lock-based by default but can be
told to operate in a merging style.  CVS and Subversion are
merge-based by default but can be told to operate in a locking mode.
Distributed version control systems, such as GNU Arch, Git, and
Mercurial, are exclusively merging-based.

  VC mode supports both locking and merging version control.  The
terms ``commit'' and ``update'' are used in newer version control
systems; older lock-based systems use the terms ``check in'' and
``check out''.  VC hides the differences between them as much as
possible.

@node VCS Changesets
@subsubsection Changeset-based vs File-based Version Control

@cindex file-based version control
  On SCCS, RCS, CVS, and other early version control systems, version
control operations are @dfn{file-based}: each file has its own comment
and revision history separate from that of all other files.  Newer
systems, beginning with Subversion, are @dfn{changeset-based}: a
commit may include changes to several files, and the entire set of
changes is handled as a unit.  Any comment associated with the change
does not belong to a single file, but to the changeset itself.

@cindex changeset-based version control
  Changeset-based version control is more flexible and powerful than
file-based version control; usually, when a change to multiple files
has to be reversed, it's good to be able to easily identify and remove
all of it.

@node VCS Repositories
@subsubsection Decentralized vs Centralized Repositories

@cindex centralized version control
@cindex decentralized version control
  Early version control systems were designed around a
@dfn{centralized} model in which each project has only one repository
used by all developers.  SCCS, RCS, CVS, and Subversion share this
kind of model.  One of its drawbacks is that the repository is a choke
point for reliability and efficiency.

  GNU Arch pioneered the concept of @dfn{decentralized} version
control, later implemented in Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar.  A project
may have several different repositories, and these systems support a
sort of super-merge between repositories that tries to reconcile their
change histories.  In effect, there is one repository for each
developer, and repository merges take the place of commit operations.

  VC helps you manage the traffic between your personal workfiles and
a repository.  Whether the repository is a single master, or one of a
network of peer repositories, is not something VC has to care about.

@node Types of Log File
@subsubsection Types of Log File
@cindex types of log file
@cindex log File, types of
@cindex version control log

  Projects that use a version control system can have two types of log
for changes.  One is the log maintained by the version control system:
each time you commit a change, you fill out a @dfn{log entry} for the
change (@pxref{Log Buffer}).  This is called the @dfn{version control
log}.

  The other kind of log is the file @file{ChangeLog} (@pxref{Change
Log}).  It provides a chronological record of all changes to a large
portion of a program---typically one directory and its subdirectories.
A small program would use one @file{ChangeLog} file; a large program
may have a @file{ChangeLog} file in each major directory.
@xref{Change Log}.  Programmers have used change logs since long
before version control systems.

  Changeset-based version systems typically maintain a changeset-based
modification log for the entire system, which makes change log files
somewhat redundant.  One advantage that they retain is that it is
sometimes useful to be able to view the transaction history of a
single directory separately from those of other directories.

  A project maintained with version control can use just the version
control log, or it can use both kinds of logs.  It can handle some
files one way and some files the other way.  Each project has its
policy, which you should follow.

  When the policy is to use both, you typically want to write an entry
for each change just once, then put it into both logs.  You can write
the entry in @file{ChangeLog}, then copy it to the log buffer with
@kbd{C-c C-a} when committing the change (@pxref{Log Buffer}).  Or you
can write the entry in the log buffer while committing the change, and
later use the @kbd{C-x v a} command to copy it to @file{ChangeLog}
@iftex
(@pxref{Change Logs and VC,,,emacs-xtra, Specialized Emacs Features}).
@end iftex
@ifnottex
(@pxref{Change Logs and VC}).
@end ifnottex

@node VC Mode Line
@subsection Version Control and the Mode Line
@cindex VC mode line indicator

  When you visit a file that is under version control, Emacs indicates
this on the mode line.  For example, @samp{Bzr-1223} says that Bazaar
is used for that file, and the current revision ID is 1223.

@cindex version control status
  The character between the back-end name and the revision ID
indicates the @dfn{version control status} of the work file.  In a
merge-based version control system, a @samp{-} character indicates
that the work file is unmodified, and @samp{:} indicates that it has
been modified.  @samp{!} indicates that the file contains conflicts as
result of a recent merge operation (@pxref{Merging}), or that the file
was removed from the version control.  Finally, @samp{?}  means that
the file is under version control, but is missing from the working
tree.

  In a lock-based system, @samp{-} indicates an unlocked file, and
@samp{:} a locked file; if the file is locked by another user (for
instance, @samp{jim}), that is displayed as @samp{RCS:jim:1.3}.
@samp{@@} means that the file was locally added, but not yet committed
to the master repository.

  On a graphical display, you can move the mouse over this mode line
indicator to pop up a ``tool-tip'', which displays a more verbose
description of the version control status.  Pressing @kbd{Mouse-1}
over the indicator pops up a menu of VC commands, identical to
@samp{Tools / Version Control} on the menu bar.

@vindex auto-revert-check-vc-info
  When Auto Revert mode (@pxref{Reverting}) reverts a buffer that is
under version control, it updates the version control information in
the mode line.  However, Auto Revert mode may not properly update this
information if the version control status changes without changes to
the work file, from outside the current Emacs session.  If you set
@code{auto-revert-check-vc-info} to @code{t}, Auto Revert mode updates
the version control status information every
@code{auto-revert-interval} seconds, even if the work file itself is
unchanged.  The resulting CPU usage depends on the version control
system, but is usually not excessive.

@node Basic VC Editing
@subsection Basic Editing under Version Control

@cindex filesets, VC
@cindex VC filesets
   Most VC commands operate on @dfn{VC filesets}.  A VC fileset is a
collection of one or more files that a VC operation acts on.  When you
type VC commands in a buffer visiting a version-controlled file, the
VC fileset is simply that one file.  When you type them in a VC
Directory buffer, and some files in it are marked, the VC fileset
consists of the marked files (@pxref{VC Directory Mode}).

  On Subversion and on decentralized version control systems,
multi-file VC filesets are handled as a single group by the relevant
version control commands.  For example, committing a multi-file VC
fileset generates a single revision, consisting of all the changes to
those files.  But on older version control systems which lack support
for group operations, such as CVS, the files in a multi-file VC
fileset are passed individually to version control commands (e.g.@: a
commit generates one revision for each changed file).

@table @kbd
@itemx C-x v v
Perform the next appropriate version control operation on the current
VC fileset.
@end table

@findex vc-next-action
@kindex C-x v v
  The principal VC command is an all-purpose command, @kbd{C-x v v}
(@code{vc-next-action}), which performs the ``most appropriate''
action on the current VC fileset: either registering it with a version
control system, or committing it, or unlocking it, or merging changes
into it.  The precise actions are described in detail in the following
subsections.  You can use @kbd{C-x v v} either in a file-visiting
buffer or in a VC Directory buffer.

  Note that VC filesets are distinct from the ``named filesets'' used
for viewing and visiting files in functional groups
(@pxref{Filesets}).  Unlike named filesets, VC filesets are not named
and don't persist across sessions.

@menu
* VC With A Merging VCS::  Without locking: default mode for CVS.
* VC With A Locking VCS::  RCS in its default mode, SCCS, and optionally CVS.
* Advanced C-x v v::       Advanced features available with a prefix argument.
@end menu

@node VC With A Merging VCS
@subsubsection Basic Version Control with Merging

  On a merging-based version control system (i.e.@: most modern ones;
@pxref{VCS Merging}), @kbd{C-x v v} does the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If there is more than one file in the VC fileset and the files have
inconsistent version control statuses, signal an error.  (Note,
however, that a fileset is allowed to include both ``newly-added''
files and ``modified'' files; @pxref{Registering}.)

@item
If none of the files in the VC fileset are registered with a version
control system, register the VC fileset, i.e.@: place it under version
control.  @xref{Registering}.  If Emacs cannot find a system to
register under, it prompts for a repository type, creates a new
repository, and registers the VC fileset with it.

@item
If every work file in the VC fileset is unchanged, do nothing.

@item
If every work file in the VC fileset has been modified, commit the
changes.  To do this, Emacs pops up a @samp{*vc-log*} buffer; type the
desired log entry for the new revision, followed by @kbd{C-c C-c} to
commit.  @xref{Log Buffer}.

If committing to a shared repository, the commit may fail if the
repository that has been changed since your last update.  In that
case, you must perform an update before trying again.  If using a
decentralized version control system, use @kbd{C-x v +} or @kbd{C-x v
m} (@pxref{Merging}).  If using a centralized version control system,
type @kbd{C-x v v} again to merge in the repository changes.

@item
Finally, if you are using a centralized version control system, check
if each work file in the VC fileset is up-to-date.  If any file has
been changed in the repository, offer to update it.
@end itemize

  These rules also apply when you use RCS in its ``non-locking'' mode,
except that changes are not automatically merged from the repository.
Nothing informs you if another user has committed changes in the same
file since you began editing it; when you commit your revision, his
changes are removed (however, they remain in the repository and are
thus not irrevocably lost).  Therefore, you must verify that the
current revision is unchanged before committing your changes.  In
addition, locking is possible with RCS even in this mode: @kbd{C-x v
v} with an unmodified file locks the file, just as it does with RCS in
its normal locking mode (@pxref{VC With A Locking VCS}).

@node VC With A Locking VCS
@subsubsection Basic Version Control with Locking

  On a locking-based version control system (such as SCCS, and RCS in
its default mode), @kbd{C-x v v} does the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If there is more than one file in the VC fileset and the files have
inconsistent version control statuses, signal an error.

@item
If each file in the VC fileset is not registered with a version
control system, register the VC fileset.  @xref{Registering}.  If
Emacs cannot find a system to register under, it prompts for a
repository type, creates a new repository, and registers the VC
fileset with it.

@item
If each file is registered and unlocked, lock it and make it writable,
so that you can begin to edit it.

@item
If each file is locked by you and contains changes, commit the
changes.  To do this, Emacs pops up a @samp{*vc-log*} buffer; type the
desired log entry for the new revision, followed by @kbd{C-c C-c} to
commit (@pxref{Log Buffer}).

@item
If each file is locked by you, but you have not changed it, release
the lock and make the file read-only again.

@item
If each file is locked by another user, ask whether you want to
``steal the lock''.  If you say yes, the file becomes locked by you,
and a warning message is sent to the user who had formerly locked the
file.
@end itemize

  These rules also apply when you use CVS in locking mode, except
that CVS does not support stealing locks.

@node Advanced C-x v v
@subsubsection Advanced Control in @kbd{C-x v v}

@cindex revision ID in version control
  When you give a prefix argument to @code{vc-next-action} (@kbd{C-u
C-x v v}), it still performs the next logical version control
operation, but accepts additional arguments to specify precisely how
to do the operation.

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the file is modified (or locked), you can specify the revision ID
to use for the new version that you commit.  This is one way to create
a new branch (@pxref{Branches}).

@item
If the file is not modified (and unlocked), you can specify the
revision to select; this lets you start working from an older
revision, or on another branch.  If you do not enter any revision,
that takes you to the highest (``head'') revision on the current
branch; therefore @kbd{C-u C-x v v @key{RET}} is a convenient way to
get the latest version of a file from the repository.

@item
@cindex specific version control system
Instead of the revision ID, you can also specify the name of a
version control system.  This is useful when one file is being managed
with two version control systems at the same time
@iftex
(@pxref{Local Version Control,,,emacs-xtra, Specialized Emacs
Features}).

@end itemize

@node Log Buffer
@subsection Features of the Log Entry Buffer

@cindex C-c C-c @r{(Log Edit mode)}
@findex log-edit-done
  When you tell VC to commit a change, it pops up a buffer named
@samp{*vc-log*}.  In this buffer, you should write a @dfn{log entry}
describing the changes you have made (@pxref{Why Version Control?}).
After you are done, type @kbd{C-c C-c} (@code{log-edit-done}) to exit
the buffer and commit the change, together with your log entry.

@cindex Log Edit mode
@cindex mode, Log Edit
@vindex vc-log-mode-hook
  The major mode for the @samp{*vc-log*} buffer is Log Edit mode, a
variant of Text mode (@pxref{Text Mode}).  On entering Log Edit mode,
Emacs runs the hooks @code{text-mode-hook} and @code{vc-log-mode-hook}
(@pxref{Hooks}).

  While in the @samp{*vc-log*} buffer, you can write one or more
@dfn{header lines}, specifying additional information to be supplied
to the version control system.  Each header line must occupy a single
line at the top of the buffer; the first line that is not a header
line is treated as the start of the log entry.  For example, the
following header line states that the present change was not written
by you, but by another developer:

@smallexample
Author: J. R. Hacker <jrh@@example.com>
@end smallexample

@noindent
Apart from the @samp{Author} header, Emacs recognizes the headers
@samp{Date} (a manually-specified commit time) and @samp{Fixes} (a
reference to a bug fixed by the change).  Not all version control
systems recognize all headers: Bazaar recognizes all three headers,
while Git, Mercurial, and Monotone recognize only @samp{Author} and
@samp{Date}.  If you specify a header for a version control that does
not support it, the header is treated as part of the log entry.

@kindex C-c C-f @r{(Log Edit mode)}
@findex log-edit-show-files
  Type @kbd{C-c C-f} (@code{log-edit-show-files}) in the
@samp{*vc-log*} buffer to view a list of files for the VC fileset that
is to be committed.  If you called @kbd{C-x v v} directly from a work
file, the fileset consists of that single file.  If you called
@kbd{C-x v v} from a VC directory buffer (@pxref{VC Directory Mode}),
the fileset may consist of multiple files; in that case, @kbd{C-c C-c}
will commit those files together, as a single revision, if that is
supported by the version control system (on older version control
systems, such as CVS, each file in a multi-file VC fileset is
committed as an individual revision).

@kindex C-c C-d @r{(Log Edit mode)}
@findex log-edit-show-diff
  Type @kbd{C-c C-d} (@code{log-edit-show-diff}) to show a @dfn{diff}
of the changes between the current VC fileset and the repository
revision from which you started editing.  @xref{Old Revisions}.

@kindex C-c C-a @r{(Log Edit mode)}
@findex log-edit-insert-changelog
  If the VC fileset that is to be committed includes one or more
@file{ChangeLog} files (@pxref{Change Log}), type @kbd{C-c C-a}
(@code{log-edit-insert-changelog}) to pull the relevant entries into
the @samp{*vc-log*} buffer.  If the topmost item in each
@file{ChangeLog} was made under your user name on the current date,
this command searches that item for entries matching the file(s) to be
committed, and inserts them.
@ifnottex
@xref{Change Logs and VC}, for the opposite way of
working---generating ChangeLog entries from the revision control log.
@end ifnottex

  To abort a commit, just @strong{don't} type @kbd{C-c C-c} in that
buffer.  You can switch buffers and do other editing.  As long as you
don't try to make another commit, the entry you were editing remains
in the @samp{*vc-log*} buffer, and you can go back to that buffer at
any time to complete the commit.

@kindex M-n @r{(Log Edit mode)}
@kindex M-p @r{(Log Edit mode)}
@kindex M-s @r{(Log Edit mode)}
@kindex M-r @r{(Log Edit mode)}
  You can also browse the history of previous log entries to duplicate
a commit comment.  This can be useful when you want to make several
commits with similar comments.  The commands @kbd{M-n}, @kbd{M-p},
@kbd{M-s} and @kbd{M-r} for doing this work just like the minibuffer
history commands (@pxref{Minibuffer History}), except that they are
used outside the minibuffer.

@node Registering
@subsection Registering a File for Version Control

@table @kbd
@item C-x v i
Register the visited file for version control.
@end table

@kindex C-x v i
@findex vc-register
  The command @kbd{C-x v i} (@code{vc-register}) @dfn{registers} each
file in the current VC fileset, placing it under version control.
This is essentially equivalent to the action of @kbd{C-x v v} on an
unregistered VC fileset (@pxref{Basic VC Editing}), except that if the
VC fileset is already registered, @kbd{C-x v i} signals an error
whereas @kbd{C-x v v} performs some other action.

  To register a file, Emacs must choose a version control system.  For
a multi-file VC fileset, the VC Directory buffer specifies the system
to use (@pxref{VC Directory Mode}).  For a single-file VC fileset, if
the file's directory already contains files registered in a version
control system, or if the directory is part of a directory tree
controlled by a version control system, Emacs chooses that system.  In
the event that more than one version control system is applicable,
Emacs uses the one that appears first in the variable
@iftex
@code{vc-handled-backends}.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@code{vc-handled-backends} (@pxref{Customizing VC}).
@end ifnottex
If Emacs cannot find a version control system to register the file
under, it prompts for a repository type, creates a new repository, and
registers the file into that repository.

  On most version control systems, registering a file with @kbd{C-x v
i} or @kbd{C-x v v} adds it to the ``working tree'' but not to the
repository.  Such files are labeled as @samp{added} in the VC
Directory buffer, and show a revision ID of @samp{@@@@} in the mode
line.  To make the registration take effect in the repository, you
must perform a commit (@pxref{Basic VC Editing}).  Note that on
changeset-based version control systems, commits can consist of both
file additions and modifications.

  On a locking-based version control system (@pxref{VCS Merging}),
registering a file leaves it unlocked and read-only.  Type @kbd{C-x v
v} if you wish to start editing it.

@node Old Revisions
@subsection Examining And Comparing Old Revisions

@table @kbd
@item C-x v =
Compare the work files in the current VC fileset with the versions you
started from (@code{vc-diff}).  With a prefix argument, prompt for two
revisions of the current VC fileset and compare them.  You can also
call this command from a Dired buffer (@pxref{Dired}).

@ifnottex
@item M-x vc-ediff
Like @kbd{C-x v =}, but using an Ediff session.  @xref{Top, Ediff,
ediff, The Ediff Manual}.
@end ifnottex

@item C-x v D
Compare all work files in the current version controlled directory
tree to the tree you started from (@code{vc-root-diff}).  With a
prefix argument, prompt for two revisions and compare their trees.

@item C-x v ~
Prompt for a revision of the current file, and visit it in a separate
buffer (@code{vc-revision-other-window}).

@item C-x v g
Display an annotated version of the current file: for each line, show
the latest revision in which it was modified (@code{vc-annotate}).
@end table

@findex vc-diff
@kindex C-x v =
  @kbd{C-x v =} (@code{vc-diff}) displays a @dfn{diff} which compares
each work file in the current VC fileset to the version(s) from which
you started editing.  The diff is displayed in another window, in a
Diff mode buffer (@pxref{Diff Mode}) named @file{*vc-diff*}.  The
usual Diff mode commands are available in this buffer.  In particular,
the @kbd{g} (@code{revert-buffer}) command performs the file
comparison again, generating a new diff.

@kindex C-u C-x v =
  To compare two arbitrary revisions of the current VC fileset, call
@code{vc-diff} with a prefix argument: @kbd{C-u C-x v =}.  This
prompts for two revision IDs (@pxref{VCS Concepts}), and displays a
diff between those versions of the fileset.  This will not work
reliably for multi-file VC filesets, if the version control system is
file-based rather than changeset-based (e.g.@: CVS), since then
revision IDs for different files would not be related in any
meaningful way.

  Instead of the revision ID, some version control systems let you
specify revisions in other formats.  For instance, under Bazaar you
can enter @samp{date:yesterday} for the argument to @kbd{C-u C-x v =}
(and related commands) to specify the first revision committed after
yesterday.  See the documentation of the version control system for
details.

  If you invoke @kbd{C-x v =} or @kbd{C-u C-x v =} from a Dired buffer
(@pxref{Dired}), the file listed on the current line is treated as the
current VC fileset.

@ifnottex
@findex vc-ediff
  @kbd{M-x vc-ediff} works like @kbd{C-x v =}, except that it uses an
Ediff session.  @xref{Top, Ediff, ediff, The Ediff Manual}.
@end ifnottex

@findex vc-root-diff
@kindex C-x v D
  @kbd{C-x v D} (@code{vc-root-diff}) is similar to @kbd{C-x v =}, but
it displays a comparison between the entire current version controlled
tree (i.e.@: the tree controlled by the version control system
associated with the current VC fileset, which may include files that
are not part of that fileset) and the tree you started with.  If you
invoke this command from a Dired buffer, it applies to the entire
version controlled tree containing the directory.

@vindex vc-diff-switches
  You can customize the @command{diff} options that @kbd{C-x v =} and
@kbd{C-x v D} use for generating diffs.  The options used are taken
from the first non-@code{nil} value amongst the variables
@code{vc-@var{backend}-diff-switches}, @code{vc-diff-switches}, and
@code{diff-switches} (@pxref{Comparing Files}), in that order.  Here,
@var{backend} stands for the current version control system,
e.g.@: @code{bzr} for Bazaar.  Since @code{nil} means to check the
next variable in the sequence, either of the first two may use the
value @code{t} to mean no switches at all.  Most of the
@code{vc-@var{backend}-diff-switches} variables default to @code{nil},
but some default to @code{t}; these are for version control systems,
such as Subversion, whose @code{diff} implementations do not accept
common diff options.

@findex vc-revision-other-window
@kindex C-x v ~
  To directly examine an older version of a file, visit the work file
and type @kbd{C-x v ~ @var{revision} @key{RET}}
(@code{vc-revision-other-window}).  This retrieves the file version
corresponding to @var{revision}, saves it to
@file{@var{filename}.~@var{revision}~}, and visits it in a separate
window.

@findex vc-annotate
@kindex C-x v g
  Many version control systems allow you to view files @dfn{annotated}
with per-line revision information, by typing @kbd{C-x v g}
(@code{vc-annotate}).  This creates a new buffer (the ``annotate
buffer'') displaying the file's text, with each line colored to show
how old it is.  Red text is new, blue is old, and intermediate colors
indicate intermediate ages.  By default, the color is scaled over the
full range of ages, such that the oldest changes are blue, and the
newest changes are red.

  When you give a prefix argument to this command, Emacs reads two
arguments using the minibuffer: the revision to display and annotate
(instead of the current file contents), and the time span in days the
color range should cover.

  From the annotate buffer, these and other color scaling options are
available from the @samp{VC-Annotate} menu.  In this buffer, you can
also use the following keys to browse the annotations of past revisions,
view diffs, or view log entries:

@table @kbd
@item p
Annotate the previous revision, i.e.@: the revision before the one
currently annotated.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat count, so
@kbd{C-u 10 p} would take you back 10 revisions.

@item n
Annotate the next revision, i.e.@: the revision after the one
currently annotated.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat count.

@item j
Annotate the revision indicated by the current line.

@item a
Annotate the revision before the one indicated by the current line.
This is useful to see the state the file was in before the change on
the current line was made.

@item f
Show in a buffer the file revision indicated by the current line.

@item d
Display the diff between the current line's revision and the previous
revision.  This is useful to see what the current line's revision
actually changed in the file.

@item D
Display the diff between the current line's revision and the previous
revision for all files in the changeset (for VC systems that support
changesets).  This is useful to see what the current line's revision
actually changed in the tree.

@item l
Show the log of the current line's revision.  This is useful to see
the author's description of the changes in the revision on the current
line.

@item w
Annotate the working revision--the one you are editing.  If you used
@kbd{p} and @kbd{n} to browse to other revisions, use this key to
return to your working revision.

@item v
Toggle the annotation visibility.  This is useful for looking just at
the file contents without distraction from the annotations.
@end table

@node VC Change Log
@subsection VC Change Log

@table @kbd
@item C-x v l
Display the change history for the current fileset
(@code{vc-print-log}).

@item C-x v L
Display the change history for the current repository
(@code{vc-print-root-log}).

@item C-x v I
Display the changes that will be received with a pull operation
(@code{vc-log-incoming}).

@item C-x v O
Display the changes that will be sent by the next push operation
(@code{vc-log-outgoing}).
@end table

@kindex C-x v l
@findex vc-print-log
  The command @kbd{C-x v l} (@code{vc-print-log}) displays a buffer
named @samp{*vc-change-log*}, showing the history of changes made to
the current file, including who made the changes, the dates, and the
log entry for each change (these are the same log entries you would
enter via the @samp{*vc-log*} buffer; @pxref{Log Buffer}).  Point is
centered at the revision of the file currently being visited.  With a
prefix argument, the command prompts for the revision to center on,
and the maximum number of revisions to display.

  If you call @kbd{C-x v l} from a VC Directory buffer (@pxref{VC
Directory Mode}) or a Dired buffer (@pxref{Dired}), it applies to the
file listed on the current line.

@findex vc-print-root-log
@findex log-view-toggle-entry-display
  @kbd{C-x v L} (@code{vc-print-root-log}) displays a
@samp{*vc-change-log*} buffer showing the history of the entire
version-controlled directory tree (RCS, SCCS, and CVS do not support
this feature).  With a prefix argument, the command prompts for the
maximum number of revisions to display.

  The @kbd{C-x v L} history is shown in a compact form, usually
showing only the first line of each log entry.  However, you can type
@key{RET} (@code{log-view-toggle-entry-display}) in the
@samp{*vc-change-log*} buffer to reveal the entire log entry for the
revision at point.  A second @key{RET} hides it again.

  On a distributed version control system, the @kbd{C-x v I}
(@code{vc-log-incoming}) command displays a log buffer showing the
changes that will be applied, the next time you run the version
control system's ``pull'' command to get new revisions from another
repository.  This other repository is the default one from which
changes are pulled, as defined by the version control system; with a
prefix argument, @code{vc-log-incoming} prompts for a specific
repository.  Similarly, @kbd{C-x v O} (@code{vc-log-outgoing}) shows
the changes that will be sent to another repository, the next time you
run the ``push'' command; with a prefix argument, it prompts for a
specific destination repository.

  In the @samp{*vc-change-log*} buffer, you can use the following keys
to move between the logs of revisions and of files, and to examine and
compare past revisions (@pxref{Old Revisions}):

@table @kbd
@item p
Move to the previous revision entry.  (Revision entries in the log
buffer are usually in reverse-chronological order, so the previous
revision-item usually corresponds to a newer revision.)  A numeric
prefix argument is a repeat count.

@item n
Move to the next revision entry.  A numeric prefix argument is a
repeat count.

@item P
Move to the log of the previous file, if showing logs for a multi-file
VC fileset.  Otherwise, just move to the beginning of the log.  A
numeric prefix argument is a repeat count.

@item N
Move to the log of the next file, if showing logs for a multi-file VC
fileset.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat count.

@item a
Annotate the revision on the current line (@pxref{Old Revisions}).

@item e
Modify the change comment displayed at point.  Note that not all VC
systems support modifying change comments.

@item f
Visit the revision indicated at the current line.

@item d
Display a diff between the revision at point and the next earlier
revision, for the specific file.

@item D
Display the changeset diff between the revision at point and the next
earlier revision.  This shows the changes to all files made in that
revision.

@item @key{RET}
In a compact-style log buffer (e.g.@: the one created by @kbd{C-x v
L}), toggle between showing and hiding the full log entry for the
revision at point.
@end table

@vindex vc-log-show-limit
Because fetching many log entries can be slow, the
@samp{*vc-change-log*} buffer displays no more than 2000 revisions by
default.  The variable @code{vc-log-show-limit} specifies this limit;
if you set the value to zero, that removes the limit.  You can also
increase the number of revisions shown in an existing
@samp{*vc-change-log*} buffer by clicking on the @samp{Show 2X
entries} or @samp{Show unlimited entries} buttons at the end of the
buffer.  However, RCS, SCCS, and CVS do not support this feature.

@node VC Undo
@subsection Undoing Version Control Actions

@table @kbd
@item C-x v u
Revert the work file(s) in the current VC fileset to the last revision
(@code{vc-revert}).
@end table

@c `C-x v c' (vc-rollback) was removed, since it's RCS/SCCS specific.

@kindex C-x v u
@findex vc-revert
@vindex vc-revert-show-diff
  If you want to discard all the changes you have made to the current
VC fileset, type @kbd{C-x v u} (@code{vc-revert-buffer}).  This shows
you a diff between the work file(s) and the revision from which you
started editing, and asks for confirmation for discarding the changes.
If you agree, the fileset is reverted.  If you don't want @kbd{C-x v
u} to show a diff, set the variable @code{vc-revert-show-diff} to
@code{nil} (you can still view the diff directly with @kbd{C-x v =};
@pxref{Old Revisions}).  Note that @kbd{C-x v u} cannot be reversed
with the usual undo commands (@pxref{Undo}), so use it with care.

  On locking-based version control systems, @kbd{C-x v u} leaves files
unlocked; you must lock again to resume editing.  You can also use
@kbd{C-x v u} to unlock a file if you lock it and then decide not to
change it.

@node VC Directory Mode
@subsection VC Directory Mode

@cindex VC Directory buffer
  The @dfn{VC Directory buffer} is a specialized buffer for viewing
the version control statuses of the files in a directory tree, and
performing version control operations on those files.  In particular,
it is used to specify multi-file VC filesets for commands like
@w{@kbd{C-x v v}} to act on (@pxref{VC Directory Commands}).

@kindex C-x v d
@findex vc-dir
  To use the VC Directory buffer, type @kbd{C-x v d} (@code{vc-dir}).
This reads a directory name using the minibuffer, and switches to a VC
Directory buffer for that directory.  By default, the buffer is named
@samp{*vc-dir*}.  Its contents are described
@iftex
below.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
in @ref{VC Directory Buffer}.
@end ifnottex

  The @code{vc-dir} command automatically detects the version control
system to be used in the specified directory.  In the event that more
than one system is being used in the directory, you should invoke the
command with a prefix argument, @kbd{C-u C-x v d}; this prompts for
the version control system which the VC Directory buffer should use.

@ifnottex
@cindex PCL-CVS
@pindex cvs
@cindex CVS directory mode
  In addition to the VC Directory buffer, Emacs has a similar facility
called PCL-CVS which is specialized for CVS.  @xref{Top, , About

@end menu

@node VC Directory Buffer
@subsubsection The VC Directory Buffer

  The VC Directory buffer contains a list of version-controlled files
and their version control statuses.  It lists files in the current
directory (the one specified when you called @kbd{C-x v d}) and its
subdirectories, but only those with a ``noteworthy'' status.  Files
that are up-to-date (i.e.@: the same as in the repository) are
omitted.  If all the files in a subdirectory are up-to-date, the
subdirectory is not listed either.  As an exception, if a file has
become up-to-date as a direct result of a VC command, it is listed.

  Here is an example of a VC Directory buffer listing:

@smallexample
@group
                     ./
    edited           configure.ac
*   added            README
    unregistered     temp.txt
                     src/
*   edited           src/main.c
@end group
@end smallexample

@noindent
Two work files have been modified but not committed:
@file{configure.ac} in the current directory, and @file{foo.c} in the
@file{src/} subdirectory.  The file named @file{README} has been added
but is not yet committed, while @file{temp.txt} is not under version
control (@pxref{Registering}).

The @samp{*} characters next to the entries for @file{README} and
@file{src/main.c} indicate that the user has marked out these files as
the current VC fileset
@iftex
(see below).
@end iftex
@ifnottex
(@pxref{VC Directory Commands}).
@end ifnottex

  The above example is typical for a decentralized version control
system like Bazaar, Git, or Mercurial.  Other systems can show other
statuses.  For instance, CVS shows the @samp{needs-update} status if
the repository has changes that have not been applied to the work
file.  RCS and SCCS show the name of the user locking a file as its
status.

@ifnottex
@vindex vc-stay-local
@vindex vc-cvs-stay-local
  On CVS and Subversion, the @code{vc-dir} command normally contacts
the repository, which may be on a remote machine, to check for
updates.  If you change the variable @code{vc-stay-local} or
@code{vc-cvs-stay-local} (for CVS) to @code{nil} (@pxref{CVS
Options}), then Emacs avoids contacting a remote repository when
generating the VC Directory buffer (it will still contact it when
necessary, e.g.@: when doing a commit).  This may be desirable if you
are working offline or the network is slow.
@end ifnottex

@vindex vc-directory-exclusion-list
  The VC Directory buffer omits subdirectories listed in the variable
@code{vc-directory-exclusion-list}.  The default value of this
variable contains directories that are used internally by version
control systems.

@node VC Directory Commands
@subsubsection VC Directory Commands

  Emacs provides several commands for navigating the VC Directory
buffer, and for ``marking'' files as belonging to the current VC
fileset.

@table @kbd
@item n
@itemx @key{SPC}
Move point to the next entry (@code{vc-dir-next-line}).

@item p
Move point to the previous entry (@code{vc-dir-previous-line}).

@item @key{TAB}
Move to the next directory entry (@code{vc-dir-next-directory}).

@item S-@key{TAB}
Move to the previous directory entry
(@code{vc-dir-previous-directory}).

@item @key{RET}
@itemx f
Visit the file or directory listed on the current line
(@code{vc-dir-find-file}).

@item o
Visit the file or directory on the current line, in a separate window
(@code{vc-dir-find-file-other-window}).

@item m
Mark the file or directory on the current line (@code{vc-dir-mark}),
putting it in the current VC fileset.  If the region is active, mark
all files in the region.

A file cannot be marked with this command if it is already in a marked
directory, or one of its subdirectories.  Similarly, a directory
cannot be marked with this command if any file in its tree is marked.

@item M
If point is on a file entry, mark all files with the same status; if
point is on a directory entry, mark all files in that directory tree
(@code{vc-dir-mark-all-files}).  With a prefix argument, mark all
listed files and directories.

@item u
Unmark the file or directory on the current line.  If the region is
active, unmark all the files in the region (@code{vc-dir-unmark}).

@item U
If point is on a file entry, umark all files with the same status; if
point is on a directory entry, unmark all files in that directory tree
(@code{vc-dir-unmark-all-files}).  With a prefix argument, unmark all
files and directories.

@item x
Hide files with @samp{up-to-date} status
(@code{vc-dir-hide-up-to-date}).

@item q
Quit the VC Directory buffer, and bury it (@code{quit-window}).
@end table

@findex vc-dir-mark
@findex vc-dir-mark-all-files
  While in the VC Directory buffer, all the files that you mark with
@kbd{m} (@code{vc-dir-mark}) or @kbd{M} (@code{vc-dir-mark}) are in
the current VC fileset.  If you mark a directory entry with @kbd{m},
all the listed files in that directory tree are in the current VC
fileset.  The files and directories that belong to the current VC
fileset are indicated with a @samp{*} character in the VC Directory
buffer, next to their VC status.  In this way, you can set up a
multi-file VC fileset to be acted on by VC commands like @w{@kbd{C-x v
v}} (@pxref{Basic VC Editing}), @w{@kbd{C-x v =}} (@pxref{Old
Revisions}), and @w{@kbd{C-x v u}} (@pxref{VC Undo}).

  The VC Directory buffer also defines some single-key shortcuts for
VC commands with the @kbd{C-x v} prefix: @kbd{=}, @kbd{+}, @kbd{l},
@kbd{i}, and @kbd{v}.

  For example, you can commit a set of edited files by opening a VC
Directory buffer, where the files are listed with the @samp{edited}
status; marking the files; and typing @kbd{v} or @kbd{C-x v v}
(@code{vc-next-action}).  If the version control system is
changeset-based, Emacs will commit the files in a single revision.

  While in the VC Directory buffer, you can also perform search and
replace on the current VC fileset, with the following commands:

@table @kbd
@item S
Search the fileset (@code{vc-dir-search}).

@item Q
Do a regular expression query replace on the fileset
(@code{vc-dir-query-replace-regexp}).

@item M-s a C-s
Do an incremental search on the fileset (@code{vc-dir-isearch}).

@item M-s a C-M-s
Do an incremental regular expression search on the fileset
(@code{vc-dir-isearch-regexp}).
@end table

@noindent
Apart from acting on multiple files, these commands behave much like
their single-buffer counterparts (@pxref{Search}).

@cindex stashes in version control
@cindex shelves in version control
  The above commands are also available via the menu bar, and via a
context menu invoked by @kbd{Mouse-2}.  Furthermore, some VC backends
use the menu to provide extra backend-specific commands.  For example,
Git and Bazaar allow you to manipulate @dfn{stashes} and @dfn{shelves}
(where are a way to temporarily put aside uncommitted changes, and
bring them back at a later time).

@node Branches
@subsection Multiple Branches of a File
@cindex branch (version control)
@cindex trunk (version control)

  One use of version control is to maintain multiple ``current''
revisions of a file.  For example, you might have different revisions of a
program in which you are gradually adding various unfinished new
features.  Each such independent line of development is called a
@dfn{branch}.  VC allows you to create branches, switch between
different branches, and merge changes from one branch to another.
Please note, however, that branches are not supported for SCCS.

  A file's main line of development is usually called the @dfn{trunk}.
You can create multiple branches from the trunk.  How the difference
between trunk and branch is made visible is dependent on whether the
VCS uses dot-pair or monotonic version IDs.

  In VCSes with dot-pair revision IDs, the revisions on the trunk are
normally IDed 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.  At any such revision, you can
start an independent branch.  A branch starting at revision 1.2 would
have revision ID 1.2.1.1, and consecutive revisions on this branch
would have IDs 1.2.1.2, 1.2.1.3, 1.2.1.4, and so on.  If there is
a second branch also starting at revision 1.2, it would consist of
revisions 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2, 1.2.2.3, etc.

   In VCSes with monotonic revision IDs, trunk revisions are IDed as
1, 2, 3, etc.  A branch from (say) revision 2 might start with 2.1 and
continue through 2.2, 2.3, etc.  But naming conventions for branches
and subbranches vary widely on these systems, and some (like
Mercurial) never depart from the monotonic integer sequence at all.
Consult the documentation of the VCS you are using.

@cindex head revision
  If you omit the final component of a dot-pair revision ID, that is called a
@dfn{branch ID}.  It refers to the highest existing revision on that
branch---the @dfn{head revision} of that branch.  The branches in the
dot-pair example above have branch IDs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.

@end menu

@node Switching Branches
@subsubsection Switching between Branches

  To switch between branches, type @kbd{C-u C-x v v} and specify the
revision ID you want to select.  On a locking-based system, this
version is then visited @emph{unlocked} (write-protected), so you can
examine it before locking it.  Switching branches in this way is allowed
only when the file is not locked.

  On a VCS with dot-pair IDs, you can omit the minor part, thus giving
only the branch ID; this takes you to the head version on the
chosen branch.  If you only type @key{RET}, Emacs goes to the highest
version on the trunk.

  After you have switched to any branch (including the main branch), you
stay on it for subsequent VC commands, until you explicitly select some
other branch.

@node Creating Branches
@subsubsection Creating New Branches

  To create a new branch from a head revision (one that is the latest
in the branch that contains it), first select that revision if
necessary, lock it with @kbd{C-x v v}, and make whatever changes you
want.  Then, when you commit the changes, use @kbd{C-u C-x v v}.  This
lets you specify the revision ID for the new revision.  You should
specify a suitable branch ID for a branch starting at the current
revision.  For example, if the current revision is 2.5, the branch ID
should be 2.5.1, 2.5.2, and so on, depending on the number of existing
branches at that point.

  To create a new branch at an older revision (one that is no longer the
head of a branch), first select that revision (@pxref{Switching
Branches}).  Your procedure will then differ depending on whether you
are using a locking or merging-based VCS.

  On a locking VCS, you will need to lock the old revision branch with
@kbd{C-x v v}.  You'll be asked to confirm, when you lock the old
revision, that you really mean to create a new branch---if you say no,
you'll be offered a chance to lock the latest revision instead.  On
a merging-based VCS you will skip this step.

  Then make your changes and type @kbd{C-x v v} again to commit a new
revision.  This automatically creates a new branch starting from the
selected revision.  You need not specially request a new branch,
because that's the only way to add a new revision at a point that is
not the head of a branch.

  After the branch is created, you ``stay'' on it.  That means that
subsequent commits create new revisions on that branch.  To leave the
branch, you must explicitly select a different revision with @kbd{C-u C-x
v v}.  To transfer changes from one branch to another, use the merge
command, described in the next section.

@node Merging
@subsubsection Merging Branches

@cindex merging changes
  When you have finished the changes on a certain branch, you will
often want to incorporate them into the file's main line of development
(the trunk).  This is not a trivial operation, because development might
also have proceeded on the trunk, so that you must @dfn{merge} the
changes into a file that has already been changed otherwise.  VC allows
you to do this (and other things) with the @code{vc-merge} command.

@table @kbd
@item C-x v m (vc-merge)
Merge changes into the work file.
@end table

@kindex C-x v m
@findex vc-merge
  @kbd{C-x v m} (@code{vc-merge}) takes a set of changes and merges it
into the current version of the work file.  It firsts asks you in the
minibuffer where the changes should come from.  If you just type
@key{RET}, Emacs merges any changes that were made on the same branch
since you checked the file out (we call this @dfn{merging the news}).
This is the common way to pick up recent changes from the repository,
regardless of whether you have already changed the file yourself.

  You can also enter a branch ID or a pair of revision IDs in
the minibuffer.  Then @kbd{C-x v m} finds the changes from that
branch, or the differences between the two revisions you specified, and
merges them into the current revision of the current file.

  As an example, suppose that you have finished a certain feature on
branch 1.3.1.  In the meantime, development on the trunk has proceeded
to revision 1.5.  To merge the changes from the branch to the trunk,
first go to the head revision of the trunk, by typing @kbd{C-u C-x v v
@key{RET}}.  Revision 1.5 is now current.  If locking is used for the file,
type @kbd{C-x v v} to lock revision 1.5 so that you can change it.  Next,
type @kbd{C-x v m 1.3.1 @key{RET}}.  This takes the entire set of changes on
branch 1.3.1 (relative to revision 1.3, where the branch started, up to
the last revision on the branch) and merges it into the current revision
of the work file.  You can now commit the changed file, thus creating
revision 1.6 containing the changes from the branch.

  It is possible to do further editing after merging the branch, before
the next commit.  But it is usually wiser to commit the merged
revision, then lock it and make the further changes.  This will keep
a better record of the history of changes.

@cindex conflicts
@cindex resolving conflicts
  When you merge changes into a file that has itself been modified, the
changes might overlap.  We call this situation a @dfn{conflict}, and
reconciling the conflicting changes is called @dfn{resolving a
conflict}.

  Whenever conflicts occur during merging, VC detects them, tells you
about them in the echo area, and asks whether you want help in merging.
If you say yes, it starts an Ediff session (@pxref{Top,
Ediff, Ediff, ediff, The Ediff Manual}).

  If you say no, the conflicting changes are both inserted into the
file, surrounded by @dfn{conflict markers}.  The example below shows how
a conflict region looks; the file is called @samp{name} and the current
master file revision with user B's changes in it is 1.11.

@c @w here is so CVS won't think this is a conflict.
@smallexample
@group
@w{<}<<<<<< name
  @var{User A's version}
=======
  @var{User B's version}
@w{>}>>>>>> 1.11
@end group
@end smallexample

@findex vc-resolve-conflicts
  Then you can resolve the conflicts by editing the file manually.  Or
you can type @code{M-x vc-resolve-conflicts} after visiting the file.
This starts an Ediff session, as described above.  Don't forget to
commit the merged version afterwards.

@findex vc-find-conflicted-file
  If there is more than one conflicted file in a merge, type @kbd{M-x
vc-find-conflicted-file} after resolving the conflicts in each file.
This command visits the next conflicted file, and moves point to the
first conflict marker in that file.

@node Multi-User Branching
@subsubsection Multi-User Branching

  It is often useful for multiple developers to work simultaneously on
different branches of a file.  CVS and later systems allow this by
default; for RCS, it is possible if you create multiple source
directories.  Each source directory should have a link named
@file{RCS} which points to a common directory of RCS master files.
Then each source directory can have its own choice of selected
revisions, but all share the same common RCS records.

  This technique works reliably and automatically, provided that the
source files contain RCS version headers
@iftex
(@pxref{Version Headers,,,emacs-xtra, Specialized Emacs Features}).
@end iftex
@ifnottex
(@pxref{Version Headers}).
@end ifnottex
The headers enable Emacs to be sure, at all times, which revision
ID is present in the work file.

  If the files do not have version headers, you must instead tell Emacs
explicitly in each session which branch you are working on.  To do this,
first find the file, then type @kbd{C-u C-x v v} and specify the correct
branch ID.  This ensures that Emacs knows which branch it is using
during this particular editing session.

@ifnottex
@include vc1-xtra.texi
@end ifnottex

@node Change Log
@section Change Logs

@cindex change log
  A change log file contains a chronological record of when and why you
have changed a program, consisting of a sequence of entries describing
individual changes.  Normally it is kept in a file called
@file{ChangeLog} in the same directory as the file you are editing, or
one of its parent directories.  A single @file{ChangeLog} file can
record changes for all the files in its directory and all its
subdirectories.

@end menu

@node Change Log Commands
@subsection Change Log Commands

@kindex C-x 4 a
@findex add-change-log-entry-other-window
  The Emacs command @kbd{C-x 4 a} adds a new entry to the change log
file for the file you are editing
(@code{add-change-log-entry-other-window}).  If that file is actually
a backup file, it makes an entry appropriate for the file's
parent---that is useful for making log entries for functions that
have been deleted in the current version.

  @kbd{C-x 4 a} visits the change log file and creates a new entry
unless the most recent entry is for today's date and your name.  It
also creates a new item for the current file.  For many languages, it
can even guess the name of the function or other object that was
changed.

@vindex add-log-keep-changes-together
  When the variable @code{add-log-keep-changes-together} is
non-@code{nil}, @kbd{C-x 4 a} adds to any existing item for the file
rather than starting a new item.

You can combine multiple changes of the same nature.  If you don't
enter any text after the initial @kbd{C-x 4 a}, any subsequent
@kbd{C-x 4 a} adds another symbol to the change.

@vindex add-log-always-start-new-record
  If @code{add-log-always-start-new-record} is non-@code{nil},
@kbd{C-x 4 a} always makes a new entry, even if the last entry
was made by you and on the same date.

@vindex change-log-version-info-enabled
@vindex change-log-version-number-regexp-list
@cindex file version in change log entries
  If the value of the variable @code{change-log-version-info-enabled}
is non-@code{nil}, @kbd{C-x 4 a} adds the file's version number to the
change log entry.  It finds the version number by searching the first
ten percent of the file, using regular expressions from the variable
@code{change-log-version-number-regexp-list}.

@cindex Change Log mode
@findex change-log-mode
  The change log file is visited in Change Log mode.  In this major
mode, each bunch of grouped items counts as one paragraph, and each
entry is considered a page.  This facilitates editing the entries.
@kbd{C-j} and auto-fill indent each new line like the previous line;
this is convenient for entering the contents of an entry.

You can use the @code{next-error} command (by default bound to
@kbd{C-x `}) to move between entries in the Change Log, when Change
Log mode is on.  You will jump to the actual site in the file that was
changed, not just to the next Change Log entry.  You can also use
@code{previous-error} to move back in the same list.

@findex change-log-merge
  You can use the command @kbd{M-x change-log-merge} to merge other
log files into a buffer in Change Log Mode, preserving the date
ordering of entries.

  Version control systems are another way to keep track of changes in
your program and keep a change log.  In the VC log buffer, typing
@kbd{C-c C-a} (@code{log-edit-insert-changelog}) inserts the relevant
Change Log entry, if one exists (@pxref{Log Buffer}).  You can also
insert a VC log entry into a Change Log buffer by typing @kbd{C-x v a}
(@code{vc-update-change-log}) in the Change Log buffer
@iftex
(@pxref{Change Logs and VC,,,emacs-xtra, Specialized Emacs Features}).
@end iftex
@ifnottex
(@pxref{Change Logs and VC}).
@end ifnottex

@node Format of ChangeLog
@subsection Format of ChangeLog

  A change log entry starts with a header line that contains the
current date, your name (taken from the variable
@code{add-log-full-name}), and your email address (taken from the
variable @code{add-log-mailing-address}).  Aside from these header
lines, every line in the change log starts with a space or a tab.  The
bulk of the entry consists of @dfn{items}, each of which starts with a
line starting with whitespace and a star.  Here are two entries, both
dated in May 1993, with two items and one item respectively.

@iftex
@medbreak
@end iftex
@smallexample
1993-05-25  Richard Stallman  <rms@@gnu.org>

        * man.el: Rename symbols `man-*' to `Man-*'.
        (manual-entry): Make prompt string clearer.

        * simple.el (blink-matching-paren-distance):
        Change default to 12,000.

1993-05-24  Richard Stallman  <rms@@gnu.org>

        * vc.el (minor-mode-map-alist): Don't use it if it's void.
        (vc-cancel-version): Doc fix.
@end smallexample

  One entry can describe several changes; each change should have its
own item, or its own line in an item.  Normally there should be a
blank line between items.  When items are related (parts of the same
change, in different places), group them by leaving no blank line
between them.

  You should put a copyright notice and permission notice at the
end of the change log file.  Here is an example:

@smallexample
Copyright 1997, 1998 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification, are
permitted provided the copyright notice and this notice are preserved.
@end smallexample

@noindent
Of course, you should substitute the proper years and copyright holder.

@node Tags
@section Tags Tables
@cindex tags and tag tables

  A @dfn{tag} is a reference to a subunit in a program or in a
document.  In program source code, tags reference syntactic elements
of the program: functions, subroutines, data types, macros, etc.  In a
document, tags reference chapters, sections, appendices, etc.  Each
tag specifies the name of the file where the corresponding subunit is
defined, and the position of the subunit's definition in that file.

  A @dfn{tags table} records the tags extracted by scanning the source
code of a certain program or a certain document.  Tags extracted from
generated files reference the original files, rather than the
generated files that were scanned during tag extraction.  Examples of
generated files include C files generated from Cweb source files, from
a Yacc parser, or from Lex scanner definitions; @file{.i} preprocessed
C files; and Fortran files produced by preprocessing @file{.fpp}
source files.

  To produce a tags table, you use the @samp{etags} command,
submitting it a document or the source code of a program.
@samp{etags} writes the tags to a @dfn{tags table file}, or @dfn{tags
file} in short.  The conventional name for a tags file is @file{TAGS}.

  Emacs uses the information recorded in tags tables in commands that
search or replace through multiple source files: these commands use
the names of the source files recorded in the tags table to know which
files to search.  Other commands, such as @kbd{M-.}, which finds the
definition of a function, use the recorded information about the
function names and positions to find the source file and the position
within that file where the function is defined.

@node Tag Syntax
@subsection Source File Tag Syntax

  Here is how tag syntax is defined for the most popular languages:

@itemize @bullet
@item
In C code, any C function or typedef is a tag, and so are definitions of
@code{struct}, @code{union} and @code{enum}.
@code{#define} macro definitions, @code{#undef} and @code{enum}
constants are also
tags, unless you specify @samp{--no-defines} when making the tags table.
Similarly, global variables are tags, unless you specify
@samp{--no-globals}, and so are struct members, unless you specify
@samp{--no-members}.  Use of @samp{--no-globals}, @samp{--no-defines}
and @samp{--no-members} can make the tags table file much smaller.

You can tag function declarations and external variables in addition
to function definitions by giving the @samp{--declarations} option to
@code{etags}.

@item
In C++ code, in addition to all the tag constructs of C code, member
functions are also recognized; member variables are also recognized,
unless you use the @samp{--no-members} option.  Tags for variables and
functions in classes are named @samp{@var{class}::@var{variable}} and
@samp{@var{class}::@var{function}}.  @code{operator} definitions have
tag names like @samp{operator+}.

@item
In Java code, tags include all the constructs recognized in C++, plus
the @code{interface}, @code{extends} and @code{implements} constructs.
Tags for variables and functions in classes are named
@samp{@var{class}.@var{variable}} and @samp{@var{class}.@var{function}}.

@item
In La@TeX{} text, the argument of any of the commands @code{\chapter},
@code{\section}, @code{\subsection}, @code{\subsubsection},
@code{\eqno}, @code{\label}, @code{\ref}, @code{\cite},
@code{\bibitem}, @code{\part}, @code{\appendix}, @code{\entry},
@code{\index}, @code{\def}, @code{\newcommand}, @code{\renewcommand},
@code{\newenvironment} or @code{\renewenvironment} is a tag.@refill

Other commands can make tags as well, if you specify them in the
environment variable @env{TEXTAGS} before invoking @code{etags}.  The
value of this environment variable should be a colon-separated list of
command names.  For example,

@example
TEXTAGS="mycommand:myothercommand"
export TEXTAGS
@end example

@noindent
specifies (using Bourne shell syntax) that the commands
@samp{\mycommand} and @samp{\myothercommand} also define tags.

@item
In Lisp code, any function defined with @code{defun}, any variable
defined with @code{defvar} or @code{defconst}, and in general the first
argument of any expression that starts with @samp{(def} in column zero is
a tag.

@item
In Scheme code, tags include anything defined with @code{def} or with a
construct whose name starts with @samp{def}.  They also include variables
set with @code{set!} at top level in the file.
@end itemize

  Several other languages are also supported:

@itemize @bullet

@item
In Ada code, functions, procedures, packages, tasks and types are
tags.  Use the @samp{--packages-only} option to create tags for
packages only.

In Ada, the same name can be used for different kinds of entity
(e.g.@:, for a procedure and for a function).  Also, for things like
packages, procedures and functions, there is the spec (i.e.@: the
interface) and the body (i.e.@: the implementation).  To make it
easier to pick the definition you want, Ada tag name have suffixes
indicating the type of entity:

@table @samp
@item /b
package body.
@item /f
function.
@item /k
task.
@item /p
procedure.
@item /s
package spec.
@item /t
type.
@end table

  Thus, @kbd{M-x find-tag @key{RET} bidule/b @key{RET}} will go
directly to the body of the package @code{bidule}, while @kbd{M-x
find-tag @key{RET} bidule @key{RET}} will just search for any tag
@code{bidule}.

@item
In assembler code, labels appearing at the beginning of a line,
followed by a colon, are tags.

@item
In Bison or Yacc input files, each rule defines as a tag the nonterminal
it constructs.  The portions of the file that contain C code are parsed
as C code.

@item
In Cobol code, tags are paragraph names; that is, any word starting in
column 8 and followed by a period.

@item
In Erlang code, the tags are the functions, records and macros defined
in the file.

@item
In Fortran code, functions, subroutines and block data are tags.

@item
In HTML input files, the tags are the @code{title} and the @code{h1},
@code{h2}, @code{h3} headers.  Also, tags are @code{name=} in anchors
and all occurrences of @code{id=}.

@item
In Lua input files, all functions are tags.

@item
In makefiles, targets are tags; additionally, variables are tags
unless you specify @samp{--no-globals}.

@item
In Objective C code, tags include Objective C definitions for classes,
class categories, methods and protocols.  Tags for variables and
functions in classes are named @samp{@var{class}::@var{variable}} and
@samp{@var{class}::@var{function}}.

@item
In Pascal code, the tags are the functions and procedures defined in
the file.

@item
In Perl code, the tags are the packages, subroutines and variables
defined by the @code{package}, @code{sub}, @code{my} and @code{local}
keywords.  Use @samp{--globals} if you want to tag global variables.
Tags for subroutines are named @samp{@var{package}::@var{sub}}.  The
name for subroutines defined in the default package is
@samp{main::@var{sub}}.

@item
In PHP code, tags are functions, classes and defines.  Vars are tags
too, unless you use the @samp{--no-members} option.

@item
In PostScript code, the tags are the functions.

@item
In Prolog code, tags are predicates and rules at the beginning of
line.

@item
In Python code, @code{def} or @code{class} at the beginning of a line
generate a tag.
@end itemize

  You can also generate tags based on regexp matching (@pxref{Etags
Regexps}) to handle other formats and languages.

@node Create Tags Table
@subsection Creating Tags Tables
@cindex @code{etags} program

  The @code{etags} program is used to create a tags table file.  It knows
the syntax of several languages, as described in
@iftex
the previous section.
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@ref{Tag Syntax}.
@end ifnottex
Here is how to run @code{etags}:

@example
etags @var{inputfiles}@dots{}
@end example

@noindent
The @code{etags} program reads the specified files, and writes a tags
table named @file{TAGS} in the current working directory.  You can
optionally specify a different file name for the tags table by using the
@samp{--output=@var{file}} option; specifying @file{-} as a file name
prints the tags table to standard output.

  If the specified files don't exist, @code{etags} looks for
compressed versions of them and uncompresses them to read them.  Under
MS-DOS, @code{etags} also looks for file names like @file{mycode.cgz}
if it is given @samp{mycode.c} on the command line and @file{mycode.c}
does not exist.

  @code{etags} recognizes the language used in an input file based on
its file name and contents.  You can specify the language with the
@samp{--language=@var{name}} option, described below.

  If the tags table data become outdated due to changes in the files
described in the table, the way to update the tags table is the same
way it was made in the first place.  If the tags table fails to record
a tag, or records it for the wrong file, then Emacs cannot possibly
find its definition until you update the tags table.  However, if the
position recorded in the tags table becomes a little bit wrong (due to
other editing), the worst consequence is a slight delay in finding the
tag.  Even if the stored position is very far wrong, Emacs will still
find the tag, after searching most of the file for it.  That delay is
hardly noticeable with today's computers.

   Thus, there is no need to update the tags table after each edit.
You should update a tags table when you define new tags that you want
to have listed, or when you move tag definitions from one file to
another, or when changes become substantial.

  One tags table can virtually include another.  Specify the included
tags file name with the @samp{--include=@var{file}} option when
creating the file that is to include it.  The latter file then acts as
if it covered all the source files specified in the included file, as
well as the files it directly contains.

  If you specify the source files with relative file names when you run
@code{etags}, the tags file will contain file names relative to the
directory where the tags file was initially written.  This way, you can
move an entire directory tree containing both the tags file and the
source files, and the tags file will still refer correctly to the source
files.  If the tags file is @file{-} or is in the @file{/dev} directory,
however, the file names are
made relative to the current working directory.  This is useful, for
example, when writing the tags to @file{/dev/stdout}.

  When using a relative file name, it should not be a symbolic link
pointing to a tags file in a different directory, because this would
generally render the file names invalid.

  If you specify absolute file names as arguments to @code{etags}, then
the tags file will contain absolute file names.  This way, the tags file
will still refer to the same files even if you move it, as long as the
source files remain in the same place.  Absolute file names start with
@samp{/}, or with @samp{@var{device}:/} on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

  When you want to make a tags table from a great number of files, you
may have problems listing them on the command line, because some systems
have a limit on its length.  The simplest way to circumvent this limit
is to tell @code{etags} to read the file names from its standard input,
by typing a dash in place of the file names, like this:

@smallexample
find . -name "*.[chCH]" -print | etags -
@end smallexample

  Use the option @samp{--language=@var{name}} to specify the language
explicitly.  You can intermix these options with file names; each one
applies to the file names that follow it.  Specify
@samp{--language=auto} to tell @code{etags} to resume guessing the
language from the file names and file contents.  Specify
@samp{--language=none} to turn off language-specific processing
entirely; then @code{etags} recognizes tags by regexp matching alone
(@pxref{Etags Regexps}).

  The option @samp{--parse-stdin=@var{file}} is mostly useful when
calling @code{etags} from programs.  It can be used (only once) in
place of a file name on the command line.  @code{Etags} will read from
standard input and mark the produced tags as belonging to the file
@var{file}.

  @samp{etags --help} outputs the list of the languages @code{etags}
knows, and the file name rules for guessing the language.  It also prints
a list of all the available @code{etags} options, together with a short
explanation.  If followed by one or more @samp{--language=@var{lang}}
options, it outputs detailed information about how tags are generated for
@var{lang}.

@node Etags Regexps
@subsection Etags Regexps

  The @samp{--regex} option provides a general way of recognizing tags
based on regexp matching.  You can freely intermix this option with
file names, and each one applies to the source files that follow it.
If you specify multiple @samp{--regex} options, all of them are used
in parallel.  The syntax is:

@smallexample
--regex=[@var{@{language@}}]/@var{tagregexp}/[@var{nameregexp}/]@var{modifiers}
@end smallexample

  The essential part of the option value is @var{tagregexp}, the
regexp for matching tags.  It is always used anchored, that is, it
only matches at the beginning of a line.  If you want to allow
indented tags, use a regexp that matches initial whitespace; start it
with @samp{[ \t]*}.

  In these regular expressions, @samp{\} quotes the next character, and
all the GCC character escape sequences are supported (@samp{\a} for
bell, @samp{\b} for back space, @samp{\d} for delete, @samp{\e} for
escape, @samp{\f} for formfeed, @samp{\n} for newline, @samp{\r} for
carriage return, @samp{\t} for tab, and @samp{\v} for vertical tab).

  Ideally, @var{tagregexp} should not match more characters than are
needed to recognize what you want to tag.  If the syntax requires you
to write @var{tagregexp} so it matches more characters beyond the tag
itself, you should add a @var{nameregexp}, to pick out just the tag.
This will enable Emacs to find tags more accurately and to do
completion on tag names more reliably.  You can find some examples
below.

  The @var{modifiers} are a sequence of zero or more characters that
modify the way @code{etags} does the matching.  A regexp with no
modifiers is applied sequentially to each line of the input file, in a
case-sensitive way.  The modifiers and their meanings are:

@table @samp
@item i
Ignore case when matching this regexp.
@item m
Match this regular expression against the whole file, so that
multi-line matches are possible.
@item s
Match this regular expression against the whole file, and allow
@samp{.} in @var{tagregexp} to match newlines.
@end table

  The @samp{-R} option cancels all the regexps defined by preceding
@samp{--regex} options.  It too applies to the file names following
it.  Here's an example:

@smallexample
etags --regex=/@var{reg1}/i voo.doo --regex=/@var{reg2}/m \
    bar.ber -R --lang=lisp los.er
@end smallexample

@noindent
Here @code{etags} chooses the parsing language for @file{voo.doo} and
@file{bar.ber} according to their contents.  @code{etags} also uses
@var{reg1} to recognize additional tags in @file{voo.doo}, and both
@var{reg1} and @var{reg2} to recognize additional tags in
@file{bar.ber}.  @var{reg1} is checked against each line of
@file{voo.doo} and @file{bar.ber}, in a case-insensitive way, while
@var{reg2} is checked against the whole @file{bar.ber} file,
permitting multi-line matches, in a case-sensitive way.  @code{etags}
uses only the Lisp tags rules, with no user-specified regexp matching,
to recognize tags in @file{los.er}.

  You can restrict a @samp{--regex} option to match only files of a
given language by using the optional prefix @var{@{language@}}.
(@samp{etags --help} prints the list of languages recognized by
@code{etags}.)  This is particularly useful when storing many
predefined regular expressions for @code{etags} in a file.  The
following example tags the @code{DEFVAR} macros in the Emacs source
files, for the C language only:

@smallexample
--regex='@{c@}/[ \t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_ \t(]+"\([^"]+\)"/'
@end smallexample

@noindent
When you have complex regular expressions, you can store the list of
them in a file.  The following option syntax instructs @code{etags} to
read two files of regular expressions.  The regular expressions
contained in the second file are matched without regard to case.

@smallexample
--regex=@@@var{case-sensitive-file} --ignore-case-regex=@@@var{ignore-case-file}
@end smallexample

@noindent
A regex file for @code{etags} contains one regular expression per
line.  Empty lines, and lines beginning with space or tab are ignored.
When the first character in a line is @samp{@@}, @code{etags} assumes
that the rest of the line is the name of another file of regular
expressions; thus, one such file can include another file.  All the
other lines are taken to be regular expressions.  If the first
non-whitespace text on the line is @samp{--}, that line is a comment.

  For example, we can create a file called @samp{emacs.tags} with the
following contents:

@smallexample
        -- This is for GNU Emacs C source files
@{c@}/[ \t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z_ \t(]+"\([^"]+\)"/\1/
@end smallexample

@noindent
and then use it like this:

@smallexample
etags --regex=@@emacs.tags *.[ch] */*.[ch]
@end smallexample

  Here are some more examples.  The regexps are quoted to protect them
from shell interpretation.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Tag Octave files:

@smallexample
etags --language=none \
      --regex='/[ \t]*function.*=[ \t]*\([^ \t]*\)[ \t]*(/\1/' \
      --regex='/###key \(.*\)/\1/' \
      --regex='/[ \t]*global[ \t].*/' \
      *.m
@end smallexample

@noindent
Note that tags are not generated for scripts, so that you have to add
a line by yourself of the form @samp{###key @var{scriptname}} if you
want to jump to it.

@item
Tag Tcl files:

@smallexample
etags --language=none --regex='/proc[ \t]+\([^ \t]+\)/\1/' *.tcl
@end smallexample

@item
Tag VHDL files:

@smallexample
etags --language=none \
  --regex='/[ \t]*\(ARCHITECTURE\|CONFIGURATION\) +[^ ]* +OF/' \
  --regex='/[ \t]*\(ATTRIBUTE\|ENTITY\|FUNCTION\|PACKAGE\
  \( BODY\)?\|PROCEDURE\|PROCESS\|TYPE\)[ \t]+\([^ \t(]+\)/\3/'

@node Select Tags Table
@subsection Selecting a Tags Table

@vindex tags-file-name
@findex visit-tags-table
  Emacs has at any time one @dfn{selected} tags table, and all the
commands for working with tags tables use the selected one.  To select
a tags table, type @kbd{M-x visit-tags-table}, which reads the tags
table file name as an argument, with @file{TAGS} in the default
directory as the default.

  Emacs does not actually read in the tags table contents until you
try to use them; all @code{visit-tags-table} does is store the file
name in the variable @code{tags-file-name}, and setting the variable
yourself is just as good.  The variable's initial value is @code{nil};
that value tells all the commands for working with tags tables that
they must ask for a tags table file name to use.

  Using @code{visit-tags-table} when a tags table is already loaded
gives you a choice: you can add the new tags table to the current list
of tags tables, or start a new list.  The tags commands use all the tags
tables in the current list.  If you start a new list, the new tags table
is used @emph{instead} of others.  If you add the new table to the
current list, it is used @emph{as well as} the others.

@vindex tags-table-list
  You can specify a precise list of tags tables by setting the variable
@code{tags-table-list} to a list of strings, like this:

@c keep this on two lines for formatting in smallbook
@example
@group
(setq tags-table-list
      '("~/emacs" "/usr/local/lib/emacs/src"))
@end group
@end example

@noindent
This tells the tags commands to look at the @file{TAGS} files in your
@file{~/emacs} directory and in the @file{/usr/local/lib/emacs/src}
directory.  The order depends on which file you are in and which tags
table mentions that file, as explained above.

  Do not set both @code{tags-file-name} and @code{tags-table-list}.

@node Find Tag
@subsection Finding a Tag

  The most important thing that a tags table enables you to do is to find
the definition of a specific tag.

@table @kbd
@item M-.@: @var{tag} @key{RET}
Find first definition of @var{tag} (@code{find-tag}).
@item C-u M-.
Find next alternate definition of last tag specified.
@item C-u - M-.
Go back to previous tag found.
@item C-M-. @var{pattern} @key{RET}
Find a tag whose name matches @var{pattern} (@code{find-tag-regexp}).
@item C-u C-M-.
Find the next tag whose name matches the last pattern used.
@item C-x 4 .@: @var{tag} @key{RET}
Find first definition of @var{tag}, but display it in another window
(@code{find-tag-other-window}).
@item C-x 5 .@: @var{tag} @key{RET}
Find first definition of @var{tag}, and create a new frame to select the
buffer (@code{find-tag-other-frame}).
@item M-*
Pop back to where you previously invoked @kbd{M-.} and friends.
@end table

@kindex M-.
@findex find-tag
  @kbd{M-.}@: (@code{find-tag}) is the command to find the definition of
a specified tag.  It searches through the tags table for that tag, as a
string, and then uses the tags table info to determine the file that the
definition is in and the approximate character position in the file of
the definition.  Then @code{find-tag} visits that file, moves point to
the approximate character position, and searches ever-increasing
distances away to find the tag definition.

  If an empty argument is given (just type @key{RET}), the balanced
expression in the buffer before or around point is used as the
@var{tag} argument.  @xref{Expressions}.

  You don't need to give @kbd{M-.} the full name of the tag; a part
will do.  This is because @kbd{M-.} finds tags in the table which
contain @var{tag} as a substring.  However, it prefers an exact match
to a substring match.  To find other tags that match the same
substring, give @code{find-tag} a numeric argument, as in @kbd{C-u
M-.}; this does not read a tag name, but continues searching the tags
table's text for another tag containing the same substring last used.
If you have a real @key{META} key, @kbd{M-0 M-.}@: is an easier
alternative to @kbd{C-u M-.}.

@kindex C-x 4 .
@findex find-tag-other-window
@kindex C-x 5 .
@findex find-tag-other-frame
  Like most commands that can switch buffers, @code{find-tag} has a
variant that displays the new buffer in another window, and one that
makes a new frame for it.  The former is @w{@kbd{C-x 4 .}}, which invokes
the command @code{find-tag-other-window}.  The latter is @w{@kbd{C-x 5 .}},
which invokes @code{find-tag-other-frame}.

  To move back to places you've found tags recently, use @kbd{C-u -
M-.}; more generally, @kbd{M-.} with a negative numeric argument.  This
command can take you to another buffer.  @w{@kbd{C-x 4 .}} with a negative
argument finds the previous tag location in another window.

@kindex M-*
@findex pop-tag-mark
@vindex find-tag-marker-ring-length
  As well as going back to places you've found tags recently, you can go
back to places @emph{from where} you found them.  Use @kbd{M-*}, which
invokes the command @code{pop-tag-mark}, for this.  Typically you would
find and study the definition of something with @kbd{M-.} and then
return to where you were with @kbd{M-*}.

  Both @kbd{C-u - M-.} and @kbd{M-*} allow you to retrace your steps to
a depth determined by the variable @code{find-tag-marker-ring-length}.

@findex find-tag-regexp
@kindex C-M-.
  The command @kbd{C-M-.} (@code{find-tag-regexp}) visits the tags that
match a specified regular expression.  It is just like @kbd{M-.} except
that it does regexp matching instead of substring matching.

@node Tags Search
@subsection Searching and Replacing with Tags Tables
@cindex search and replace in multiple files
@cindex multiple-file search and replace

  The commands in this section visit and search all the files listed
in the selected tags table, one by one.  For these commands, the tags
table serves only to specify a sequence of files to search.  These
commands scan the list of tags tables starting with the first tags
table (if any) that describes the current file, proceed from there to
the end of the list, and then scan from the beginning of the list
until they have covered all the tables in the list.

@table @kbd
@item M-x tags-search @key{RET} @var{regexp} @key{RET}
Search for @var{regexp} through the files in the selected tags
table.
@item M-x tags-query-replace @key{RET} @var{regexp} @key{RET} @var{replacement} @key{RET}
Perform a @code{query-replace-regexp} on each file in the selected tags table.
@item M-,
Restart one of the commands above, from the current location of point
(@code{tags-loop-continue}).
@end table

@findex tags-search
  @kbd{M-x tags-search} reads a regexp using the minibuffer, then
searches for matches in all the files in the selected tags table, one
file at a time.  It displays the name of the file being searched so you
can follow its progress.  As soon as it finds an occurrence,
@code{tags-search} returns.

@kindex M-,
@findex tags-loop-continue
  Having found one match, you probably want to find all the rest.  To find
one more match, type @kbd{M-,} (@code{tags-loop-continue}) to resume the
@code{tags-search}.  This searches the rest of the current buffer, followed
by the remaining files of the tags table.@refill

@findex tags-query-replace
  @kbd{M-x tags-query-replace} performs a single
@code{query-replace-regexp} through all the files in the tags table.  It
reads a regexp to search for and a string to replace with, just like
ordinary @kbd{M-x query-replace-regexp}.  It searches much like @kbd{M-x
tags-search}, but repeatedly, processing matches according to your
input.  @xref{Replace}, for more information on query replace.

@vindex tags-case-fold-search
@cindex case-sensitivity and tags search
  You can control the case-sensitivity of tags search commands by
customizing the value of the variable @code{tags-case-fold-search}.  The
default is to use the same setting as the value of
@code{case-fold-search} (@pxref{Search Case}).

  It is possible to get through all the files in the tags table with a
single invocation of @kbd{M-x tags-query-replace}.  But often it is
useful to exit temporarily, which you can do with any input event that
has no special query replace meaning.  You can resume the query
replace subsequently by typing @kbd{M-,}; this command resumes the
last tags search or replace command that you did.  For instance, to
skip the rest of the current file, you can type @kbd{M-> M-,}.

  The commands in this section carry out much broader searches than the
@code{find-tag} family.  The @code{find-tag} commands search only for
definitions of tags that match your substring or regexp.  The commands
@code{tags-search} and @code{tags-query-replace} find every occurrence
of the regexp, as ordinary search commands and replace commands do in
the current buffer.

  These commands create buffers only temporarily for the files that they
have to search (those which are not already visited in Emacs buffers).
Buffers in which no match is found are quickly killed; the others
continue to exist.

  It may have struck you that @code{tags-search} is a lot like
@code{grep}.  You can also run @code{grep} itself as an inferior of
Emacs and have Emacs show you the matching lines one by one.
@xref{Grep Searching}.

@node List Tags
@subsection Tags Table Inquiries

@table @kbd
@item M-x list-tags @key{RET} @var{file} @key{RET}
Display a list of the tags defined in the program file @var{file}.
@item M-x tags-apropos @key{RET} @var{regexp} @key{RET}
Display a list of all tags matching @var{regexp}.
@end table

@findex list-tags
  @kbd{M-x list-tags} reads the name of one of the files described by
the selected tags table, and displays a list of all the tags defined in
that file.  The ``file name'' argument is really just a string to
compare against the file names recorded in the tags table; it is read as
a string rather than as a file name.  Therefore, completion and
defaulting are not available, and you must enter the file name the same
way it appears in the tags table.  Do not include a directory as part of
the file name unless the file name recorded in the tags table includes a
directory.

@findex tags-apropos
@vindex tags-apropos-verbose
  @kbd{M-x tags-apropos} is like @code{apropos} for tags
(@pxref{Apropos}).  It finds all the tags in the selected tags table
whose entries match @var{regexp}, and displays them.  If the variable
@code{tags-apropos-verbose} is non-@code{nil}, it displays the names
of the tags files together with the tag names.

@vindex tags-tag-face
@vindex tags-apropos-additional-actions
  You can customize the appearance of the output by setting the
variable @code{tags-tag-face} to a face.  You can display additional
output with @kbd{M-x tags-apropos} by customizing the variable
@code{tags-apropos-additional-actions}---see its documentation for
details.

  You can also use the collection of tag names to complete a symbol
name in the buffer.  @xref{Symbol Completion}.

  You can use @kbd{M-x next-file} to visit the files in the selected
tags table.  The first time this command is called, it visits the
first file in the tags table.  Each subsequent call visits the next
file in the table, unless a prefix argument is supplied, in which case
it returns to the first file.

@node EDE
@section Emacs Development Environment
@cindex EDE (Emacs Development Environment)
@cindex Emacs Development Environment
@cindex Integrated development environment

EDE (@dfn{Emacs Development Environment}) is a package that simplifies
the task of creating, building, and debugging large programs with
Emacs.  It provides some of the features of an IDE, or @dfn{Integrated
Development Environment}, in Emacs.

This section provides a brief description of EDE usage.
@ifnottex
For full details, see @ref{Top, EDE,, ede, Emacs Development Environment}.
@end ifnottex
@iftex
For full details on Ede, type @kbd{C-h i} and then select the EDE
manual.
@end iftex

  EDE is implemented as a global minor mode (@pxref{Minor Modes}).  To
enable it, type @kbd{M-x global-ede-mode} or click on the
@samp{Project Support (EDE)} item in the @samp{Tools} menu.  You can
also enable EDE each time you start Emacs, by adding the following
line to your initialization file:

@smallexample
(global-ede-mode t)
@end smallexample

@noindent
Activating EDE adds a menu named @samp{Development} to the menu bar.
Many EDE commands, including the ones described below, can be invoked
from this menu.

  EDE organizes files into @dfn{projects}, which correspond to
directory trees.  The @dfn{project root} is the topmost directory of a
project.  To define a new project, visit a file in the desired project
root and type @kbd{M-x ede-new}.  This command prompts for a
@dfn{project type}, which refers to the underlying method that EDE
will use to manage the project (@pxref{Creating a Project, EDE,, ede,
Emacs Development Environment}).  The most common project types are
@samp{Make}, which uses Makefiles, and @samp{Automake}, which uses GNU
Automake (@pxref{Top, Automake,, automake, Automake}).  In both cases,
EDE also creates a file named @file{Project.ede}, which stores
information about the project.

  A project may contain one or more @dfn{targets}.  A target can be an
object file, executable program, or some other type of file, which is
``built'' from one or more of the files in the project.

  To add a new @dfn{target} to a project, type @kbd{C-c . t}
(@code{M-x ede-new-target}).  This command also asks if you wish to
``add'' the current file to that target, which means that the target
is to be built from that file.  After you have defined a target, you
can add more files to it by typing @kbd{C-c . a}
(@code{ede-add-file}).

  To build a target, type @kbd{C-c . c} (@code{ede-compile-target}).
To build all the targets in the project, type @kbd{C-c . C}
(@code{ede-compile-project}).  EDE uses the file types to guess how
the target should be built.
